		<p>The Plinian Society in Edinburgh first met on 14 January 1823. It met
		  at the University (then known as Edinburgh College). During the first meeting,
		  Mr. John Baird, one of the presidents, made a statement on the 'proposed plan
		  and objects' of the Society - to advance the study of natural history,
		  antiquities, and the physical sciences in general. Baird also showed a
		  collection of simple minerals, mountain rocks and shells, and Mr. Thompson
		  showed a specimen of galena 'associated with Pearl-spar and Fluorspar'.
		  Included among the honorary members of the Society were: Robert Jameson,
		  Professor of Natural History at Edinburgh University; Thomas C. Hope, Professor
		  of Chemistry; Robert Graham, Professor of Botany; Sir Walter Scott; and, Sir
		  Humphry Davy. An illustrious ordinary member of the Society was Charles Darwin
		  (1809-1882) who was proposed by co-members Brown, Coldstream and Fife on 28
		  November 1826. Darwin was unanimously elected as an ordinary member, and during
		  a subsequent meeting held on 5 December 1826 to elect office bearers he was
		  elected to the council of the Society. On 27 March 1827, Darwin communicated to
		  the Society two discoveries that he had made: firstly that the ova of the
		  flustra possessed organs of motion; and, secondly, that the small black
		  globular body hitherto mistaken for the young fucus lorius was in reality the
		  ovum of the pontobdella muricata. The Plinian Society requested that he draw up
		  a factual account and to submit it with specimens. Darwin did this on 3 April
		  1827. </p>
