		<p>George Goudie Chisolm was born in Edinburgh on 1 May 1850. He was
		  educated at the city's Royal High School, and studied at the University of
		  Edinburgh where he graduated MA in 1870. He had a gift for languages and was
		  able to function in Latin, Greek, French, German and Italian. He started out on
		  a literary career working in the editorial department of publishers W.G.
		  Blackie &amp;amp; Son (Glasgow). Chisolm left for London in 1881, and apart
		  from taking the degree of B.Sc. in Natural Sciences in Edinburgh in 1883,
		  London was to be his home until 1908. Specialising in Geography, he became a
		  University Extension Lecturer, and established for himself a solid reputation
		  in the subject. With the setting up of a Lectureship in Geography at Edinburgh
		  University in 1908, Chisolm was the obvious choice. He became Reader in 1921.
		  His first geographical work was 
		<title>The two hemispheres </title> (1882). Around the same time, the
		Royal Geographical Society had come to realise that Geography was badly
		neglected in Britain in comparison to European countries, both in the
		universities and in schools. Chisolm however was already prepared for the task
		of advancing the status of the subject. A series of school geographies was
		prepared, and a school atlas. Other more ambitious works were 
		<title>Handbook of commercial geography </title> (1889), and 
		<title>Gazetteer of the world </title> (1895) which later became known as
		
		<title>The Times gazetteer </title>. Chisolm retired from Edinburgh
		University in 1923. He had long been the Secretary of the Royal Scottish
		Geographical Society. George Goudie Chisolm died in Edinburgh on 9 February
		1930. </p>
