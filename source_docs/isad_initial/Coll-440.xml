		<p>Alexander Monro, the son of John Monro, a surgeon, was born on 8
		  September 1697 in London. He was educated at Edinburgh University after a
		  family move to the city, and he obtained his M.D. there before going to London
		  to attend lectures on experimental philosophy and dissection. On his return to
		  Edinburgh he established a reputation for himself in the field of anatomy. A
		  visit to Paris followed before a study period at Leyden in the Netherlands in
		  1718 under Herman Boerhaave (1668-1738). In 1719, Monro was appointed Professor
		  of Anatomy and Surgery to the Surgeon's Company, and then in 1720 he became the
		  first Professor of Anatomy at Edinburgh University. His course of lectures
		  included the history of anatomy, the treating of osteology, the treating of the
		  soft parts, the relation of the anatomy of animals to that of man, surgical
		  operations, and general physiology. In 1745 he tended to the wounded on the
		  battlefield after the Battle of Prestonpans. His published works include 
		<title>Osteology, a treatise on the anatomy of the human bones</title>
		(1726), and 
		<title>An account of the inoculation of smallpox in Scotland</title>. In
		July 1755 Monro's son Alexander joined him as Joint Professor and in 1764 he
		resigned his Professorship although continued to give clinical lectures.
		Professor Alexander Monro, primus, died of a pelvic cancer on 10 July 1767.
