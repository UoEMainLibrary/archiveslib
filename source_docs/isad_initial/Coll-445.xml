		<p>The literary critic, translator and Scottish poet Edwin Muir was born
		  in Deerness, Orkney, on 15 May 1887. He was educated in Kirkwall but also lived
		  in Glasgow with his family. In 1908 he began writing for the journal 
		<title>The new age</title> edited by A. R. Orage in London. Muir lived in
		London, writing literary reviews, and he also lived in Prague, at Hellerau near
		Dresden, and in St. Tropez where he wrote and taught English. It was the
		publication of 
		<title>The voyage</title> (1946) and 
		<title>The Labyrinth</title> (1949) that brought him recognition as a
		poet. Translations of Kafka in the 1930s had established his reputation. Other
		publications include 
		<title>We moderns</title> (1918), and the works of criticism 
		<title>Transition</title> (1926), 
		<title>The three brothers</title> (1931) and 
		<title>Poor Tom</title> 1932). Works of poetry include 
		<title>Narrow place</title> (1943) and 
		<title>One foot in Eden</title> (1956). Edwin Muir died in Cambridge on 3
		January 1959.</p>
