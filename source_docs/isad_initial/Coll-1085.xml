		<head>Administrative/Biographical History</head> 
		<p>David Smith was born in South Wales on 21 May 1930. He was educated at
		  Colston's School, Bristol, and at St. Paul's School, London, and then studied
		  at The Queen's College, Oxford, where he was awarded the degrees of B.A. (first
		  class honours in Botany), 1951, and Ph.D., 1954. After National Service, his
		  academic career continued with a research fellowship at Queen's and he was
		  Harkness Visiting Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley. Smith was
		  back in Oxford in 1960, this time holding a University Lectureship in the
		  Department of Agricultural Science, as well as an appointment as Royal Society
		  Senior Research Fellow, then Tutorial Fellow and Admissions Tutor at Wadham
		  College. In 1975, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society.</p> 
		<p>Smith then held the Melville Wills Chair of Botany at the University
		  of Bristol, and in 1980 he became Professor of Rural Economy at the University
		  of Oxford and Head of the Department of Agricultural Science. In 1986 he was
		  knighted, and in 1987 he was appointed Principal of Edinburgh University in
		  succession to John Harrison Burnett.</p> 
		<p>The published work of Sir David Smith centres on the biology of
		  symbiosis and was initially concerned with associations between algae and
		  fungi, and latterly with a variety of associations between algae and animals.
		  With A. Douglas he published 
		<title>The biology of symbiosis</title> (1987).</p> 
		<p>During his period as Principal at Edinburgh, the University was
		  confronted by challenges in the area of teaching (staff-student ratios), in
		  research (assessments), and in financial policy, but through the resourceful
		  leadeship that Smith provided, the University had been able to strengthen these
		  areas again by the time that he retired in 1994.</p> 
		<p>Sir David Smith's portrait was painted by Scottish painter and
		  printmaker Dame Elizabeth Blackadder (b. 1931) and it was unveiled on 21 March
		  1994.</p> 
		<p>From April 1994 to 2000, Sir David Smith was President of Wolfson
		  College, Oxford.</p>
