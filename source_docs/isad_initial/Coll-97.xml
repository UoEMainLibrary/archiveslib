		<p>The Carmichael-Watson Collection consists of papers belonging to the
		  Reverend Alexander Cameron of Arran, Alexander Carmichael, civil servant and
		  folklorist, Alexander MacBain of Inverness, and Professor William John Watson
		  and his son James Carmichael Watson, along with books and papers belonging to
		  the Reverend Charles Robertson of Jura, the Reverend Angus MacDonald, the
		  Reverend Archibald MacDonald and the Reverend Father Allan McDonald of Eriskay.
		  Alexander Carmichael was born in Lismore, off the coast of Argyll, in 1832. He
		  was educated at Greenock Academy, and in Edinburgh. As a civil servant with
		  Customs and Excise, his work took him to Skye, Uist and Oban, where in the
		  middle of the 19th century Gaelic still dominated. He collaborated with the
		  folklorist John Francis Campbell (1822-1885) in his folklore collection, and
		  made a large collection of his own between 1855 and 1899 and particularly from
		  1865 to 1882 when the family resided in the Hebrides. His collection consisted
		  mainly of Gaelic prayers and invocations, hymns, blessings, charms, and a great
		  many songs. The material was collected from both mainland and island sources
		  and range in date over several centuries. Carmichael would finally settle in
		  Edinburgh. His publications include 
		<title>Grazing and agrestic customs of the Outer Hebrides </title> (1884)
		which had been requested for the Report of the Crofter Royal Commission, and 
		<title>Carmina Gadelica </title> (1900). Alexander Carmichael died in
		1912. Elizabeth (Ella) Catherine Carmichael, his daughter, married William John
		Watson. The Gaelic scholar William John Watson was born in Easter Ross in 1865.
		He was Rector of Inverness Royal Academy and then Edinburgh's Royal High
		School, and later, between 1914 and 1938, Professor of Celtic at Edinburgh
		University. His publications include 
		<title>Place names of Ross and Cromarty </title> (1904), 
		<title>Gaelic prose </title> (1915), 
		<title>Gaelic poetry </title> (1918), 
		<title>History of the Celtic place-names of Scotland </title> (1926), and
		
		<title>Scottish verse from the book of the Dean of Lismore </title>
		(1937). Professor William John Watson died in 1948. His son, James Carmichael
		Watson, born in 1910, and successor to his father as Professor of Celtic at
		Edinburgh University in 1938, contributed to later volumes of 
		<title>Carmina Gadelica </title>. James Carmichael Watson died, missing
		in action, in 1942. </p>
