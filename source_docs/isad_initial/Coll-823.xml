		<p>The Dukes of Buccleuch descend from Sir Richard le Scot (1249-1285) of
		  Rankilburn and Murthockston, and from Sir Walter Scott of Branxholm, the latter
		  of whom was granted lands in Selkirkshire by King James II in 1452. The Earldom
		  dates from 1619 and the Dukedom from 1663 when Anne, daughter and heiress of
		  the 2nd Earl of Buccleuch, married James Duke of Monmouth, the bastard son of
		  Charles II. The title passed to their grandson Francis (1694-1751), 2nd
		  Duke.</p> 
		<p>The 3rd Duke of Buccleuch succeeded to the Douglas Dukedom of
		  Queensberry and married the daughter and heiress of the Duke of Montagu.</p> 
		<p>Walter Francis was the second son of Charles William Henry
		  (1772-1819), 4th Duke of Buccleuch and 6th Duke of Queensberry. He was born on
		  25 November 1806 and succeeded to his title in 1819. He studied at St. John's
		  College, Cambridge, from which he obtained an MA in 1827. Walter Francis
		  married Lady Charlotte Anne Thynne, the youngest daughter of Thomas, 2nd
		  Marquess of Bath, in 1829. The 5th Duke of Buccleuch was ADC to Queen Victoria,
		  Captain-General of the Royal Company of Archers, Lord-Lieutenant and Sheriff
		  Principal of Midlothian and Roxburgh, Honourable Colonel of the 3rd Battalion
		  Royal Scots Lothian Regiment, High Steward of Westminster, and Chancellor of
		  Glasgow University. He had also been Lord Privy Seal, 1842-1846, and Lord
		  President of Council, 1846. He was responsible for the building of the pier and
		  breakwater at Granton Harbour, Edinburgh, 1835-1842. Walter Francis Montague
		  Douglas Scott (1806-1884), 5th Duke of Buccleuch and 7th Duke of Queensberry,
		  died on 16 April 1884.</p> 
		<p>The present holder of the title is Walter Francis John Montague
		  Douglas Scott (b. 1923), 9th Duke of Buccleuch and 11th Duke of Queensberry,
		  who succeeded to the title from his father in 1973. His heir is Richard Walter
		  John Montague Douglas Scott (b. 1954), Earl of Dalkeith.</p> 
		<p>Bowhill, dating mainly from 1812 and with garden and landscape
		  designed by John Gilpen, has been the Scottish Borders home of the Dukes and
		  Duchesses of Buccleuch. They also reside at Drumlanrig Castle in Nithsdale.
