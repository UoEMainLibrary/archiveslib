		<p>Joseph Houldsworth Oldham, pioneer of ecumenical missionary and social
		  concern, was born in 1874 of Scottish parents in India. He was educated in
		  Edinburgh and at Oxford from where he graduated in 1896. A religious conversion
		  prompted Oldham to travel to India in 1897 to work with the YMCA where he
		  stayed for three years, marrying Mary Fraser in 1898. Illness forced them to
		  return in 1901 and Oldham went on to study theology at New College, Edinburgh
		  and in Germany. On his return to Scotland he was twice an assistant minister
		  but was unable to secure his own ministry. In 1908 he became organising
		  secretary for the 1910 World Missionary Conference at Edinburgh, regarded by
		  many as the starting point of the modern ecumenical movement, and he was
		  subsequently secretary of the Conference Continuation committee. In 1912 Oldham
		  founded the 
		<title>International Review of Missions</title> which, under Oldham's
		editorship until 1927, established itself as the most prominent missionary
		periodical in the world.</p> 
		<p>During World War 1 Oldham worked to keep the spirit of
		  internationalism alive through his writings and became a trusted adviser of the
		  government on missions and German missionaries in particular. With the return
		  of peace Oldham continued to promote the cause of co-operation between mission
		  boards. He became the founder and secretary in 1921 of the International
		  Missionary Council. He also travelled widely (often with his secretary Betty
		  Gibson) and was especially concerned with education and the issues raised by
		  colonial administration in Africa. His knowledge of both India and Africa
		  thrust him into the role of mediator between Europeans, Africans and Indians in
		  Kenya and his principle that African native interests should be paramount was
		  embodied in government policy in 1923. Also in that year Oldham was a key
		  figure in the establishment of a committee on Native Education in Tropical
		  Africa. His 
		<title>Christianity and the Race Problem</title> was published in 1924
		and was his most substantial and successful book. After organising the first
		conference of missionary educators and colonial administrators in 1926, he was
		instrumental in securing funds for the founding of the International Institute
		of African Languages and Cultures. From 1931 to 1938 he was its administrative
		director and responsible for much of the work which made Lord Hailey's 
		<title>African Survey</title> possible.</p> 
		<p>Oldham continued, often in partnership with Lord Lugard, to advise on
		  government and administration in Kenya, however he also remained concerned
		  about the future of the Christian missions and the church. As a layperson
		  Oldham grew more convinced of role of the laity in this future and the need for
		  a co-operative relationship between religious and secular groups and, to this
		  end, encouraged small study groups as a means of research. He was, from 1934,
		  chairman of the research committee of the Universal Christian Council for Life
		  and Work and a key figure at the 1937 Oxford conference. His efforts were to
		  influence Christian thinking for a generation and lead to the formation of the
		  World Council of Churches.</p> 
		<p>During the Second World War he continued to encourage debate about lay
		  responsibility in society. Through the meetings of his 'Moot' with such figures
		  as T.S. Eliot and John Baillie and through his 
		<title>Christian Newsletter</title> he initiated much new thinking about
		Christian responsibility in modern society. From his efforts the Christian
		Frontier Council developed. Oldham retired from public life to Dunford, Sussex
		but continued to write, particularly about Africa, and was involved with the
		formation of the Capricorn Africa Movement. He was awarded honorary degrees
		from Edinburgh (1931) and Oxford (1937) and appointed CBE in 1951. Oldham's
		wife died in 1965 and Oldham himself died in 1969 at St Leonards-on-Sea,
		Sussex. Dr Kathleen Bliss, who collected much of the Oldham material together,
		worked with Oldham from the establishment of the 
		<title>Christian Newsletter</title> and Christian Frontier Council and
		later worked for the Church of England Board of Education. She was a close
		friend of Oldham's and had intended to write his biography but died in 1989
		before she could complete it.</p>

	 <scopecontent> 
		<p>The collection contains: Oldham's correspondence (1892-1965) including
		  references to Oldham's conversion and his work in India with the YMCA, to his
		  work to promote co-operation between missions and denominations such as through
		  the 1910 World Missionary Conference, the 1937 Oxford conference and the World
		  Council of Churches, to German missionaries in World War 1 and Germany in the
		  1930s, to Indian and African (particularly educational and East African)
		  issues, to the establishment of the International Institute of African
		  Languages and Cultures and other research projects, and to publications and
		  lectures by Oldham; material relating to the Moot including minutes
		  (1938-1947), papers and reports; articles, papers, addresses, notes and other
		  material by Oldham (c 1909-1957) including drafts of books and material on the
		  Advisory Committee on Native Education in Africa (1931-1934); pamphlets, press
		  cuttings, reports, minutes and other items collected by or about Oldham
		  including obituaries; extracts from journals by Betty Gibson recording trips
		  with Oldham (c 1921-1928); engagement diaries of Oldham (1921-1956) and his
		  colleague Kathleen Bliss (1943-1980); notes made by Bliss and other biographers
		  on research into Oldham's life, correspondence of Bliss about Oldham
		  biographies, archives sources and reminiscences (1960s-1987) including some
		  items from Oldham's family; and photographs.</p> 
	 </scopecontent> 
	 <arrangement> 
		<p>The papers are arranged in six main sections in broadly chronological
		  order. Items collected or copied by Bliss and others have been filed with
		  'original' Booth items so it is difficult to identify the provenance of each
		  item. The sections are as follows: 1) Boxes 1-11 contain correspondence
		  (1829-1990) including copies of relevant letters from the John White papers; 2)
		  Boxes 12-14 contain Moot papers (1938-1950); 3) Boxes 15-23 contain material
		  relating to works by Oldham and others including biographical items about
		  Oldham; 4) Boxes 24-25 contain miscellaneous items including photographs,
		  journals and reports on visits abroad and documents relating to various other
		  topics; 5) Boxes 26 and 27 contain diaries; 6) items 28 and 29 are printed
		  books. Photographs have been filed with other material in boxes 11 and 24. MSS
		  5026 (1934-1958, possibly material from Gibson: various reports and printed
		  items on Africa and a letter from Oldham to Gibson about the IMC history) and
		  5027 (1931-1934: material on the Advisory Committee on Native Education in
		  Africa) are filed separately. There is a single item, a letter from Oldham to
		  H.R. Mackintosh about the IRM (1916) filed in MSS BOX 25.3.3.</p> 
	 </arrangement> 
	 <custodhist> 
		<p>The papers were collected together by Dr Kathleen Bliss from the early
		  1960s as part of her research for a biography of Oldham. They came from Oldham
		  himself (or members of his family), from his secretary Betty Gibson, from
		  members of the Moot, from friends and colleagues of Oldham or were copied by
		  Bliss from other archival collections. The original Oldham papers are not
		  complete, some were destroyed by Oldham and others, particularly those dealing
		  with East Africa and Lord Lugard, were given by him to Margery Perham and are
		  now in Rhodes House Library, Oxford. Bliss died in 1989 and her literary
		  executor, Professor Duncan Forrester of New College took charge of the
		  papers.</p> 
	 </custodhist> 
	 <acqinfo> 
		<p>The papers in the MSS OLD group were presented to Edinburgh University
		  New College Library by Professor Duncan B. Forrester in 1989. The MSS 5026-7
		  material was donated by him in 1999.</p>

	 <otherfindaid> 
		<p>The Index to Manuscripts held at New College Library mentions the
		  collection. A full handlist, created by Dr Willaim Naphy in 1993, with index
		  and synopsis of correspondence is filed in the New College Inventory of
		  Manuscripts under MSS OLD.</p> 
	 </otherfindaid> 
	 <relatedmaterial> 
		<p>Correspondence and notes about related sources can be found in the
		  collection itself, particularly in boxes 11 and 21. The inventory to the Oldham
		  papers at New College Library lists some related archives in Lambeth Palace
		  Library and at the Public Record Office. Betty Gibson did not give all of her
		  papers to Katherine Bliss, she presented more material, including letters and
		  journals describing trips with Oldham, to New College Library in 1979. This is
		  kept separately from the Oldham papers (reference MSS GIBS). Oldham himself
		  gave some of his papers relating to East Africa to Margery Perham and these are
		  now in Rhodes House Library, Oxford (reference MSS. Afr. s. 1829). The papers
		  of John Baillie, also at New College (MSS BAI) also contain material of
		  relevance to Oldham in particular papers on the Moot and the WCC. The National
		  Library of Scotland has an extensive missionary collection including some
		  Oldham correspondence. London University Institute of Education holds papers
		  relating to The Moot and references to these and other sources can be found at
		  the National Register of Archives.</p>
