		<p>William Francis Ainsworth was born in 1807 and came from Lancashire.
		  He followed natural history classes at Edinburgh University. He became a
		  Licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1827. Ainsworth
		  then studied geology in London, Paris (at the Ecole des Mines) and Brussels
		  before taking up medical work, chiefly in relation to cholera, in England and
		  Ireland. In 1835 he accompanied an expedition to the Euphrates under Francis
		  Rawdon Chesney (1789-1872) as a surgeon and geologist, and between 1838 and
		  1840 he took charge of an expedition to the Christians of Chaldea. Ainsworth
		  published accounts of both expeditions including observations in zoology. His
		  publications include 
		<title>Travels in the track of the ten thousand Greeks</title> (1844),
		and 
		<title>A personal narrative of the Euphrates expedition</title> (1888).
		He edited 
		<title>Lares and penates, or, Cilicia and its governors: being a short
		  historical account of that province from the earliest times to the present
		  day</title> (1853) and provided a geographical commentary in 
		<title>The Anabasis: or, Expedition of Cyrus and the memorabilia of
		  Socrates</title> (1872). In 1830, Ainsworth had founded the 
		<title>Edinburgh journal of natural and geographical science</title> and
		was the editor of 
		<title>New monthly magazine</title> in 1871. He was an original Fellow of
		the Royal Geographical Society.William Francis Ainwsorth died in 1896.</p>
