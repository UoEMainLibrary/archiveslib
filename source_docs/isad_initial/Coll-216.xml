		<p>Joseph Gibson Haldane, Church of Scotland missionary in India, was
		  born in 1887. He was based at the mission in Chingleput, South India, where he
		  was widely known for his educational as well as missionary work. Haldane was
		  popular with the Indians that he worked with, partly because of the respect
		  that he showed for the Hindu religion and culture. He left India in 1934
		  because of the ill health of his wife and died in 1977. </p> 
	 </bioghist> 
	 <scopecontent> 
		<p>The collection consists of circular letters from the Church of
		  Scotland regarding the training of missionaries and youth movements (1929-30);
		  letters from missionaries at Conjeeveram (Kanchipuram), South India to Haldane
		  giving news of the mission and an agenda for a mission meeting (1930); a letter
		  from Haldane in India to members of the YMCA and YWCA in Glasgow thanking them
		  for their donations (c 1930); a proposed scheme of church union in South India
		  (1930); a circular letter from the Church of Scotland Mission, Chingleput
		  regarding Haldane's visit to the Convention of the Marthoma Syrian Christian
		  Church (c 1930); and a farewell address to Haldane by the citizens of
		  Chingleput (1934).</p>
