		<p>John Wilson was born in Faversham, Kent, on 5 April 1595. He became a
		  distinguished lutenist and in 1635 he succeeded Alphonso Bales as Musician to
		  the King. When Oxford was the stronghold of the court of Charles I, Wilson's
		  compositions won great popularity, particularly around the university. In 1645,
		  he graduated Mus.Doc.Oxon. and the following year, on the fall of the Oxford
		  garrison, he entered the service of Sir William Walter of Sarsden. In 1656 he
		  was appointed Choragus at Oxford (at Oxford, a Choragus was originally
		  appointed to superintend the practice of music) but in 1661 he resigned the
		  post to become Chamber Musician to Charles II. The following year, in 1662, he
		  was appointed Gentleman of the Chapel Royal, and was given accommodation at
		  Horseferry. John Wilson died on 22 February 1674. He was buried in Westminster
		  Abbey.</p>
