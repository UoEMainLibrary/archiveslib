		<p>William Muir was born in Glasgow in 1819. He was educated at
		  Kilmarnock Academy and then at Edinburgh and Glasgow Universities. After his
		  university education he gained a post with the East India Company in the
		  North-West Provinces of India. He entered the Bengal Civil Service in 1837 and
		  became Secretary to the Governor of the North-West Provinces at Agra. His work,
		  particularly during the Sepoy Mutiny (when he was in charge of the Intelligence
		  Department) and his experience, influence, and writing on the history of Islam,
		  led to his appointment in 1868 as Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West
		  Provinces. He had been created Knight Commander of the Star of India in 1867.
		  Between 1874 and 1876 Muir was Financial Minister to the Government of India,
		  and from 1876 to 1885 he was a Member of the Council of the Secretary of State
		  for India. On leaving India he joined the Council of India in London but
		  resigned on his appointment as Principal and Vice-Chancellor of Edinburgh
		  University in 1885. During his term of office, the University underwent many
		  changes as a result of the Universities (Scotland) Act of 1889. Muir resigned
		  in 1903 because of ill health and died at Dean Park House in Edinburgh on 11
		  July 1905. </p>
