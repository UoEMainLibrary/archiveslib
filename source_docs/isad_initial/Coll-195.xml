	 <bioghist> 
		<p>Robert Dick was born in Tullibody, Clackmannanshire, in central
		  Scotland, in January 1811. At the age of thirteen he was apprenticed to a
		  baker, but he also read widely and began to acquire a knowledge of botany. As a
		  journeyman baker he worked in Leith, Glasgow and Greenock and in 1830 he went
		  to Thurso in Caithness where he began to establish himself as a baker. In
		  Caithness, Dick also studied geology and widened his knowledge of natural
		  history, accumulating a broad collection of British flora and even
		  re-discovering Northern Holy-Grass (Hierochloe borealis). He corresponded with
		  the geologist Hugh Miller (1802-1856) contributing significantly to his
		  arguments and his research on old red sandstone. Dick became an authority on
		  the geology and natural history of Caithness and aided the geologist Sir
		  Roderick Impey Murchison (1792-1871) in his research. Latterly, the loss of
		  flour in a shipwreck ruined his bakery business and Robert Dick died at the age
		  of fifty-five on 24 December 1866.</p>

	 <scopecontent> 
		<p>The correspondence in the collection consists entirely of letters to
		  Charles William Peach about the plants and fossils of Caithness. Some comments
		  too against Darwin's theory of evolution. There are also obituaries,
		  press-cuttings and letters about Robert Dick.</p>
