		<p>The physician Richard Bright was born in Bristol on 28 September 1789.
		  He matriculated at Edinburgh University in 1808 first with the Faculty of Arts
		  then with the Faculty of Medicine. In 1810 came a visit to Iceland after which
		  he contributed chapters on botany and zoology to George Mackenzie's 
		<title>Travels in Iceland</title> (1811). He then studied anatomy and
		surgery at Guy's Hospital and St. Thomas's, London. He also became interested
		in geology at this time. In 1812, Bright returned to Edinburgh, again studying
		medicine but also geology and natural history. He graduated with the degree of
		MD in 1812, having written the dissertation 
		<title>De Erysipelate Contagioso</title>. Between 1814 and 1815, he
		travelled to the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, and Hungary, and after his
		return to England he became an Assistant Physician at the London Fever
		Hospital. After contracting a fever himself, he began travelling again in 1818,
		this time to Germany, Italy and France. In 1820 he became an Assistant
		Physician at Guy's Hospital and then in 1824 he became a full Physician there.
		During these early years at Guy's, Bright gave courses on botany in relation to
		pharmacy, and gave clinical and medical lectures. In 1827 he published the
		first volume of reports of medical cases which contained his discovery of what
		came to be termed Bright's disease, Morbus Brightii. A second volume appeared
		in 1831. While at Guy's he also assisted Thomas Addison (1793-1860) in the
		composition of the text-book 
		<title>Elements of the practice of medicine</title> (1839). On the
		accession of Queen Victoria, Bright was appointed Physician Extraordinary to
		the Queen. He retired from Guy's in 1843. In addition to the works mentioned
		above, he published many accounts of his travels and other medical treatises.
		Richard Bright died at his house in Savile Row, London, on 16 December
		1858.</p> 
		<p>Bright's youngest son also became a physician and practiced in Cannes
		  in the south of France. His oldest son was James Franck Bright who was born in
		  London on 29 May 1832. James Franck Bright was educated at Rugby and at
		  University College, Oxford. He became a Master at Marlborough College and was
		  Head of the Modern Department there for sixteen years. In 1872, Bright returned
		  to Oxford this time to Balliol New College and as a History Tutor. In 1874 he
		  was a Fellow and Dean of University College, Oxford, and in 1878 an Honorary
		  Fellow of Balliol. Between 1881 and 1906 he was Master of University College,
		  Oxford. His publications include 
		<title>History of England to 1900</title> and 
		<title>Lives of Maria Theresa and Joseph II</title> (1897). James Franck
		Bright died in October 1920. </p>

		<p>The papers are composed of an accumulation of manuscript letters to
		  both Richard Bright and his son James Franck Bright and letters between other
		  correspondents. The letters collected by daughters in the Bright family include
		  those from Roget, Lord Salisbury, Oscar Wilde, Sir Henry Rider Haggard,
		  Elizabeth Fry, and Robert Browning and many other nineteenth century notables.
		  The collection includes a fragment from the final manuscript draft of Charles
		  Darwin's 
		<title>Origin of the species</title>. Another significant signature is
		that of Zeppelin. </p>
