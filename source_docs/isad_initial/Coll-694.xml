		<p>The writer and critic Professor David Daiches was born in Sunderland
		  on 2 September 1912. He was the son of the author Rabbi Dr. Salis Daiches
		  (1880-1945), Edinburgh Hebrew Congregation. The younger Daiches was educated at
		  George Watson's College, Edinburgh, and studied at Edinburgh University and
		  Balliol College, Oxford. Between 1935 and 1936 he was an Assistant in English
		  at Edinburgh University and then from 1936 to 1937 was a Fellow at Balliol
		  College, Oxford. Daiches began to be published at this time - 
		<title>The place of meaning in poetry</title> (1935), 
		<title>New literary values</title> (1936), and 
		<title>Literature and society</title> (1938). During the Second World War
		he was Assistant Professor of English at the University of Chicago from 1939
		until 1943, before becoming Second Secretary at the British Embassy, Washington
		DC, from 1944 to 1946. After the War he was Professor of English at Cornell
		University, 1946-1951, and in 1947 he founded the Scottish Universities'
		International Summer School (SUISS). From 1951 until 1962, Daiches was an
		English Lecturer at Cambridge University, and a Fellow of Jesus College,
		Cambridge, from 1957 to 1962. During this period too he went back to the USA as
		Visiting Professor of Criticism at Indiana University, 1956-1957. He was
		appointed as Professor of English at the University of Sussex where he stayed
		from 1961 to 1977. He was also Dean of the School of English Studies, 1961 to
		1968. Daiches was awarded the CBE in 1991, and he was, for a time, Director of
		the Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities (IASH) at Edinburgh
		University. Latterly he was Emeritus Professor at Sussex. His other published
		works spanning some sixty years of output include
