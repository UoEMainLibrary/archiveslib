		<p>Sierra Leone lies in West Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean,
		  between Guinea and Liberia. It became an independent nation on 27 April 1961.
		  Prior to that it had been a British possession.</p> 
		<p>Sierra Leone had become Africa's first modern nation when freed slaves
		  from America, Britain, and elsewhere in Africa were resettled there around
		  Freetown from 1787 until the nineteenth century. The Sierra Leone Company had
		  been formed in 1791 and it administered the settlement there until 1808 when it
		  became a Crown Colony. In 1896 the British set up a Protectorate over the
		  hinterland of Freetown, the capital.</p> 
		<p>Sierra Leone has substantial mineral, agricultural, and fishery
		  resources, with minerals as diverse as diamonds, titanium ore, bauxite, iron
		  ore, gold, and chromite. Even so, the country is quite poor with an
		  underdeveloped economic and social infrastructure and great inequality in
		  income distribution. In July 2002 its population was estimated as 5,614,743. Of
		  these, 60 per cent were Muslim, 30 per cent followed indigenous beliefs, and
		  some 10 per cent were Christian. Since 1991, civil war between the government
		  and the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) has resulted in tens of thousands of
		  deaths and the displacement of more than 2 million people (well over one-third
		  of the population) many of whom are now refugees in neighbouring countries</p> 
	 </bioghist> 
	 <scopecontent> 
		<p>The collection includes photographs taken in Sierra Leone at the time
		  of independence, programme of the independence day celebrations, and pamphlets,
		  brochures and magazines commemorating the celebration of independence.</p>

		<p>The local Indexes show other references to material related to Sierra
		  Leone (check the Indexes for more details): slavery in Sierra Leone mentioned
		  in a letter of T. Perronet Thompson to R. Watson, 1824, at Dc.4.101-103; and
		  Sierra Leone mentioned in a letter of R. Hay to Sir C. Stuart, Baron de
		  Rothesay, 1829, at Dk.6.25/77. In addition, the UK National Register of
		  Archives (NRA), updated by the Historical Manuscripts Commission, notes this
		  Sierra Leone related material: mission papers, 1803-1914, Birmingham University
		  Information Services, Special Collections Department, Ref. CMS/A1 NRA 7630 CMS
