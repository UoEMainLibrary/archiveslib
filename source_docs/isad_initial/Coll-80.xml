		<p>William Lindsay Renwick was born in Glasgow on 6 January 1889. He
		  studied at Glasgow University, graduating with First Class Honours in English
		  in 1911. He then went on to study French and Italian Literature at Toulouse,
		  the Sorbonne, and the British School in Rome. After the war he studied at
		  Merton College, Oxford, where he received a B.Litt. for a thesis on Edmund
		  Spenser. During the First World War Renwick served with the Cameronians
		  (Scottish Rifles), 1914-1919, experiencing trench warfare. In 1921 he was
		  appointed Professor of English Language and Literature at King's College
		  (University of Durham) at Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Prior to that appointment he was
		  a Lecturer at Glasgow University. During the Second World War he spent a year
		  in China as a visiting Professor, lecturing with the British Council. Renwick
		  came to Edinburgh University in 1945 and was Regius Professor of Rhetoric and
		  English until 1959. During his time at Edinburgh the sub-department of English
		  for Foreign Students was established and he was also involved in the setting up
		  of the School of Scottish Studies. His publications include 
		<title>Edmund Spenser - An essay on renaissance poetry </title> (1925), 
		<title>Spenser's works </title> (1928), 
		<title>John of Bordeaux </title> (1936), 
		<title>The beginnings of English literature </title> (1939), a
		contribution to the 
		<title>Oxford history of English literature </title> dealing with the
		period 1715-1815. He also edited Spenser's
