		<p>James Duff was born on 29 September 1729. He was the second son of
		  William Duff (d. 1763), Earl of Fife, Lord Braco of Kilbryde, Viscount Macduff,
		  in the Peerage of Ireland. Like his father before him he was MP for Banff,
		  elected first in 1754, then re-elected in 1761, 1768, 1774, and 1780. In 1784
		  he was MP for Elgin. He succeeded to the Earldom in 1763 and became a British
		  Peer in 1790, as Baron Fife. He held the title of Lord Lieutenant of Banffshire
		  and he founded the town and harbour of Macduff. Duff was well-known as an
		  agricultural authority and breeder of cattle. James Duff, 2nd Earl of Fife,
		  Baron Fife, died at Whitehall, London, on 24 January 1809.</p>
