		<p>Charles Stuart was born on 2 January 1779, and was the son of General
		  Sir Charles Stuart (1753-1801). The younger Stuart entered the Diplomatic
		  Service and became Joint Charge d'Affaires in Madrid in 1808. In 1810, as an
		  envoy to Portugal, he was created Count of Machico and Marquis of Angra, and
		  Knight Grand Cross of the Tower and Sword (Portuguese Order: Ordem Militar da
		  Torre e Espada). On 20 September 1812 he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the
		  Order of the Bath and a Privy Councillor. Stuart was a Minister at The Hague,
		  1815-1816, and also Ambassador to Paris from 1815 to 1830. During this period,
		  on 22 January 1828, he was created Baron Stuart de Rothesay of the Isle of
		  Bute. He was appointed as Ambassador to St. Petersburg in 1841 until 1845. He
		  married Elizabeth Margaret, the third daughter of the 3rd Earl of Hardwicke.
		  One of his daughters, Charlotte, married Charles John, Earl of Canning, and the
		  other, Louisa, married Henry, 3rd Marquis of Waterford. Sir Charles Stuart,
		  Baron Stuart de Rothesay, died on 6 November 1845.</p>
