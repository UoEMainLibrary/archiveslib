		<p>John Campbell was born in Forfar, Angus, on 5 October 1794. He was
		  educated locally and then started a blacksmith apprenticeship. In 1818 however
		  he went to St. Andrews University, and later to Glasgow University, and then
		  was ordained. He worked in a parish in Ayrshire and then moved to the
		  Tabernacle, Moorfields, London where he stayed until the early 1840s when he
		  turned to writing. Earlier, in 1839, he was involved in a press controversy
		  with the Royal printers over Bible monopoly, and the letters were published in
		  a volume. In 1844 he established the 
		<title>Christian witness</title> and then in 1846 the 
		<title>Christian penny magazine</title>. In 1849 he started 
		<title>The British banner</title>, a weekly newspaper, and then later on 
		<title>The British ensign</title>. Campbell was an opponent of Roman
		Catholicism and ritualism. The Rev. John Campbell died on 26 March 1867.</p>
