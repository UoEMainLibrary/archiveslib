		<p>Alexander Hamilton was born in 1739 at Fordoun, Kincardineshire, in
		  north-east Scotland, where his father, a retired army surgeon, had his
		  practice. In 1758, Hamilton became an assistant to John Straiton, an Edinburgh
		  surgeon, and in 1762 he was admitted as a member of the Royal College of
		  Surgeons, Edinburgh. He then obtained a medical degree and became a Fellow of
		  the Royal College of Physicians, Edinburgh. After successfully lecturing on
		  midwifery for a number of years, he was appointed as joint-Professor of
		  Midwifery at Edinburgh University in 1780, and then as sole Professor in 1783
		  on the death of Dr. Thomas Young. He was instrumental in the establishment of
		  Edinburgh's Lying-in Hospital in 1791. Hamilton's publications include: 
		<title>Elements of the practice of midwifery</title> (1775), 
		<title>Outlines of the theory and practice of midwifery</title> (1784),
		and 
		<title>Treatise on the management of female complaints, and of children
		  in early infancy</title> (1792). Professor Alexander Hamilton resigned in 1800
		and died on 23 May 1802. </p>
