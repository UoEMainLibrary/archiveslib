		<p>Writer and reviewer John Middleton Murry was born in Peckham, London,
		  6 August 1889. In 1901 he won a scholarship to Christ's Hospital, and reached
		  Brasenose College, Oxford, also on a scholarship, and studied Classics. His
		  literary career began in 1911 with the establishment of 
		<title>Rhythm </title>, a quarterly. This ceased after only two years but
		in 1912 he had begun a journalistic career as a reviewer for the 
		<title>Westminster Gazette </title>, and later the 
		<title>Times Literary Supplement </title>. Between 1919 and 1921, Murry
		edited the 
		<title>Athenaeum </title>, and he founded the magazine 
		<title>Adelphi </title> (1923), later the 
		<title>New Adelphi </title>. His first books were 
		<title>Fyodor Dostoevsky: a critical study </title> (1916) and a work of
		fiction 
		<title>Still life </title> (1916). Murry's second work of fiction was 
		<title>The things we are </title> (1922). Lyric poetry, poetry, verse
		drama, and series of lectures on style followed, and then a third novel 
		<title>The voyage </title> (1924). In the 1920s, Murry's interests
		shifted from literature to religious philosophy, and in the 1930s he converted
		to Marxism and then moved politically towards pacifism. His writing of the
		period reflected these shifts in interest. Long an admirer of Keats, he wrote 
		<title>Keats and Shakespeare: a study of Keats' poetic life from 1816 to
		  1820 </title> (1925), and 
		<title>Studies in Keats </title> (1930). Another literary portrait was 
		<title>Jonathan Swift: a critical biography </title> (1954). Murry
		promoted the work of his wife, Katherine Mansfield, after her death in 1923,
		and his friendship with D. H. Lawrence inspired an autobiography of the great
		novelist after his death in 1930, 
		<title>Son of woman: the story of D. H. Lawrence </title> (1931). His
		last book was 
		<title>Love, freedom and society </title> (1957). Murry died 12 March
		1957. </p>
