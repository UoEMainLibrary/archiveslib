		<p>The poet Helen Burness Cruickshank was born near Hillside, Montrose,
		  in Angus, on 15 May 1886. She was educated at the local Hillside Public School
		  and at Montrose Academy. In 1903, she joined the Post Office as a civil servant
		  in London. There she became involved with the Suffragette movement and in
		  particular with the Woman Clerks' Association which campaigned for better pay
		  for women. In 1912, Cruickshank returned to Edinburgh, working in the newly
		  established National Health Insurance Scheme. In Edinburgh she made contact
		  with Christopher Murray Grieve (1892-1978), otherwise known as Hugh MacDiarmid,
		  and William Soutar (1898-1943), among many other writers and artists. She
		  became involved with Scottish PEN (an association of poets, playwrights,
		  editors, essayists and novelists) founded by Grieve. Cruickshank's poems are
		  rich in the sights and sounds of 20th century Scotland and contain sharp
		  political perception of the position both of women and of Scotland. On the
		  death of her father in 1924, she looked after and then nursed her aged mother
		  for many years and some of her poetry confronts the sadness of lifelong
		  virginity and childlessness. At a graduation ceremonial on 2 July 1970,
		  Cruickshank was awarded the honorary degree of M.A. from Edinburgh University
		  for her services to literature. Helen Burness Cruickshank suffered a slight
		  stroke in 1973 and in 1974 she entered Queensberry Lodge, Edinburgh, where care
		  and emergency help was on hand. She died there on 2 March 1975. </p>
