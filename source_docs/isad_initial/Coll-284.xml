		<p>William Archer was born in Perth, Scotland, on 23 August 1856. He
		  studied at Edinburgh University where he graduated with the degree of M.A. in
		  1876. He then became a journalist with the Edinburgh 
		<title>Evening News</title> until 1878, when he travelled to Australia.
		In 1878 he settled in London devoting himself to the study of theatre and
		becoming dramatic critic of the 
		<title>London Figaro</title> between 1879 and 1881. He also began
		translating some of the work of Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen (1828-1906)
		including 
		<title>Pillars of society</title> which was produced at London's Gaiety
		Theatre in December 1880, becoming the first Ibsen production in England.
		Travels in Italy followed between 1881 and 1882 before he was called to the Bar
		at the Middle Temple in 1883. In 1884, Archer became dramatic critic of 
		<title>World</title>, a post which he held until 1905. He translated 
		<title>A doll's house</title> which was produced at the Novelty Theatre
		in June 1889. His other publications and translations include Ibsen's 
		<title>Peer Gynt</title> (1892) which had been done in collaboration with
		his brother Lt.-Col. Charles Archer (1861-1941), the eleven volumes of Ibsen's 
		<title>Collected works</title> (1906-1908), 
		<title>India and the future</title> (1917), and 
		<title>The green goddess</title> (1921) his one successful play. Archer
		had also been the dramatic critic of the 
		<title>Tribune</title>, the 
		<title>Nation</title>, and the 
		<title>Star</title>. In his lifetime he had contributed to the raising of
		the standard of English theatre and had worked for the abolition of theatrical
		censorship and for the formation of a national theatre. William Archer died on
		27 December 1924.</p>
