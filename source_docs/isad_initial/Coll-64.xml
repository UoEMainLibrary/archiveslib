		<p>Kenneth Mackenzie was born in Strathpeffer, Ross-shire, on 29 June
		  1920. He was educated at Fodderty Primary School, 1926-32, and at Dingwall
		  Academy, 1932-37. He then went to Aberdeen University where he graduated M.A.
		  in 1940. Mackenzie then took theological training in the Free Church College,
		  Edinburgh, 1940-42, and at New College, 1942-44. On 20 April 1944 he was
		  licensed by the Presbytery of Edinburgh, and ordained as a missionary by the
		  same Presbytery on 24 April 1945. He first served in Mlanje, Malawi (then
		  Nyasaland), 1946-47 and then at Zomba, 1947-48, learning the essentials of the
		  languages there. Then he served in Lubwa, Zambia (then Northern Rhodesia),
		  1948-50, and at Chitambo, 1952-54, where he tackled more language study and a
		  study of the different cultures of the region. Prior to service at Chitambo he
		  served in the Foreign Mission Offices in Edinburgh, 1950-52. Mackenzie regarded
		  his mission as one of making the people of Scotland, and especially the Church
		  of Scotland, aware of the facts in the Central African situation at a time of
		  great and critical political change for the continent. He also played a
		  prominent part in the transference of mission schools to Government, and in the
		  discussions leading to Church union. During this period he persuaded the
		  Northern Rhodesian Christian Council of the need for urgent action on the
		  proposals for a Central African Federation and of the need for firmer
		  safeguards for African interests. Indeed, through his work for he became the
		  confidant of African leaders who were planning for independence. Mackenzie
		  returned to Scotland in 1956 for family reasons, resigning from his service
		  with the Foreign Mission Committee in Blantyre. He was seconded to the staff of
		  St. Colm's College, Edinburgh, on 31 August 1957, and remained there until 1968
		  when he was inducted to the charge of Restalrig. He was Minister of Restalrig
		  Parish Church, 1968-71. Mackenzie died in Edinburgh on 17 February 1971. </p>
