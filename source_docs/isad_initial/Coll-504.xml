		<p>Balfour Stewart was born in Edinburgh on 1 November 1828. He was
		  educated in Dundee, at St. Andrews University and then at Edinburgh University.
		  At the latter, he attended the lectures of Professor James David Forbes
		  (1809-1868). For a time he worked in the office of a Leith merchant and went to
		  Australia on business in 1855. There he acquired a taste for physical science
		  and contributed a couple of articles to the Philosophical Society in Victoria,
		  Australia. When he returned to Britain in 1856 he became an assistant observer
		  at the Kew Observatory, and later on that year an assistant to Forbes in
		  Edinburgh where he conducted research on radiant heat under Forbes' influence.
		  In 1859 he was appointed Director at Kew and devoted himself to the study of
		  meteorology and terrestrial magnetism. During a great magnetic disturbance in
		  1859, Stewart put forward the view that aurorae, magnetic storms, and
		  earth-currents were due to 'variations in a primary electric current in the
		  sun'. Stewart also investigated the pressure of a given volume of air, a
		  re-determination of the density of mercury, and sun spots. In July 1870 he was
		  appointed Professor of Natural Philosophy at the then Owens College, Manchester
		  (University of Manchester). Professor Balfour Stewart died at Ballymagarvey,
		  near Drogheda on 19 December 1887.</p>

		<p>The local Indexes show various references to material related to
		  Professor James David Forbes (check the Indexes for more details): letters to
		  Macedonio Melloni, at Gen. 1733/58, 81; letters to Professor R. Jameson, at
		  Gen. 1999/1/63 and Gen. 1996/14/1; letters to Sir Charles Lyell, at Gen. 108
		  etc; letters to T. J. Torrie at Gen. 1996/14/2-19; and letters to P. G. Tait,
		  at Gen. 2169/58-62. There are also letters to Forbes from Rev. T. Chalmers, at
		  Gen. 1429/10/22, a note from John Phillips at Gen. 1999/1/131, mention in
		  letters of J. Murray and of Professor R. Jameson at Gen. 1996/7/32, 34, 35, and
		  in Gen. 1730 etc, and a report of a Forbes lecture on university reform among
		  the Lyell material at Gen. 108 etc. In addition, the UK National Register of
		  Archives (NRA), updated by the Historical Manuscripts Commission, notes several
		  locations of both Stewart and Forbes material.</p>
