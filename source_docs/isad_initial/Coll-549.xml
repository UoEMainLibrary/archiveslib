		<p>In the 1970s, the Medical Research Council conducted a Scottish survey
		  of short stature in children, with particular reference to growth hormone
		  deficiency. A circular letter was sent to various Scottish schools proposing
		  the screening - with parental consent - for measurement of the height of
		  children in Primary 2 and Primary 3.</p> 
	 </bioghist> 
	 <scopecontent> 
		<p>The material is composed of: letters to schools; equipment orders;
		  papers noting the reason for the study, nature of the study, method of study,
		  difficulties likely to be met, personnel involved, and costs; papers showing
		  progress; much individual child data; application forms for M.R.C. clinical
		  trial of human growth hormone; and, agenda and minutes of M.R.C. working party
		  on human growth hormone.</p>
