		<head>Administrative/Biographical History</head> 
		<p>The Unit for the Study of Government in Scotland, now subsumed by the
		  Institute of Governance, was acknowledged as the leading centre in the country
		  for studies of Scottish society and politics. At the centre of the Unit's work
		  was the study of policy-making and the political process in Scotland, set in a
		  broad comparative and international context. Constitutional change in Scotland
		  had been one of the Unit's central themes since its founding in the mid-1970s
		  for which it drew on diverse disciplines, notably in Law and Social Sciences.
		  It conducted The Scottish Election Study, which provided an in-depth account of
		  how and why Scotland voted at the 1997 General Election, especially in the
		  context of long-term changes in electoral attitudes and behaviour. A similar
		  study had focused on the Scottish Referendum in September 1997. </p> 
		<p>The Unit was followed by the Governance of Scotland Forum in 1998, and
		  then by the Institute of Governance in 2002</p> 
		<p>A number of publications had emanated from the Unit throughout the
		  1980s and 1990s on a variety of issues, including pieces on the re-organisation
		  of Scottish local government, management of councils, financing Scottish home
		  rule, gender and Scottish society, labour market policy in Britain,
		  citizenship, Scottish churches and the political process, women in Scottish
		  politics, data protection and privacy, and democratic participation in the
		  Scottish Parliament.</p>
