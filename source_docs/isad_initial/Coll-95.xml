		<p>Neurologist, student and author in medical and family history, William
		  Joseph Marie Alois Maloney was born in Edinburgh on 16 October 1882. He studied
		  at Edinburgh University where he was awarded the degree of Bachelor of Medicine
		  in 1905, and then Doctor of Medicine in 1907. He also studied in Paris, Munich,
		  and London until 1909. Maloney went to the USA in 1911 where he became eminent
		  as a neurologist. He became the Professor of Nervous and Mental Disorders in
		  Fordham University, New York City's Jesuit University, and was awarded the
		  degree of Doctor of Laws from Fordham in 1923. He was also the Professor of
		  Nervous and Mental Diseases at the Post-Graduate Hospital and Medical School,
		  New York. In the early-1950s, Maloney was a Consultant Neurologist at the City
		  Hospital, New York. During the First World War he served in the British army,
		  1914-1916, and at Gallipoli he was badly wounded and permanently incapacitated
		  as a result of his wounds. He was discharged with the rank of Captain, and
		  decorated with the Military Cross and other medals. He also earned the MBE
		  during his career as a neurologist. His publications include 
		<title>George and John Armstrong of Castleton: two eighteenth-century
		  medical pioneers </title> (1954). William Joseph M. A. Maloney died in
		Edinburgh as the result of an accident on 3 September 1952. </p>
