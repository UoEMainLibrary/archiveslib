		<p>Although the Copperbelt of Zambia (formerly Northern Rhodesia) is
		  situated in the very heart of Africa and some 1,500 miles from the coast by
		  rail, and another 6,000 miles from the port of Beira in Mozambique to European
		  markets, the percentage of copper mineralisation in the ore from Zambia made
		  exploitation worthwhile. According to Francis L. Coleman, the world average of
		  copper mineralisation in ore in the 1960s and 1970s was 1.5 percent, and
		  deposits of as low as 0.7 percent could be profitable depending on location
		  etc. In fact the Copperbelt ore averaged around 3.5 percent copper.</p> 
		<p>Francis L. Coleman holds the degrees and diplomas of M.A., Dip.Ed.,
		  PhD. At the time of publication of his 
		<title>Northern Rhodesia Copperbelt 1899-1962: technological development
		  up to the end of the Central African Federation</title> (by Manchester
		University Press, Augustus M. Kelley Publishers) in 1971, Coleman was Senior
		Lecturer in Economics and Economic History at Rhodes University, Grahamstown,
		South Africa. Other works by Coleman include 
		<title>Marxism, the church and South Africa</title> (1978), 
		<title>St. Aidan's College Grahamstown</title> (1980), 
		<title>Economic history of South Africa</title> (1983), 
		<title>The Kaffrarian rifles, 1876-1988: 'nunc animis'</title> (1988),
		and 
		<title>A brief survey of the origins, spread, and activities of the
		  Catholic Order of the Knights of da Gama, on the occasion of the 50th
		  anniversary of its founding in Durban on 20 November 1943</title> (1993).</p>
