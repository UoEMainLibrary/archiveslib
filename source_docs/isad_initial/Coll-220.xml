		<p>Robert Moffat, Scottish missionary in South Africa, was born in 1795
		  at Ormiston, East Lothian. In 1813 he left home for High Leigh, near Liverpool
		  where he worked as an under-gardener and where he became a Methodist. He was
		  appointed as a missionary to South Africa by the London Missionary Society in
		  1816 and arrived at Cape Town in 1817. He spent his first year in Namaqualand
		  where he converted the chief, Jager Afrikaner. In 1819 Moffat married Mary
		  Smith who had come out from England to be with him and who was to play a vital
		  role in his work. After some moves, caused by warfare amongst Zulu tribesmen,
		  the Moffats opened a mission station in 1825 in Kuruman, south-east of the
		  Kalahari, where they stayed for forty-nine years. The station became one of the
		  foremost Protestant missionary communities in Africa and attracted many
		  converts to the church. Moffat was known for his efforts to improve living
		  standards in Africa by improving methods of agriculture and irrigation. He
		  travelled widely, paying several visits to the Ndebele with whose chief he had
		  become friendly. His last visit in 1859 resulted in the establishment of an
		  London Missionary Society mission near Bulawayo, Matabeleland. Moffat became
		  fluent in the Tswana (Setswana / Sechwana / Bechuana) language and in 1839
		  completed his translation of the New Testament. His translations became a
		  standard and were of enormous importance to the growth of Christianity in
		  Southern Africa. He also translated 
		<title>Pilgrim's Progress</title>, compiled a Tswana hymn-book and in
		1857 the whole bible was published in Tswana. He spent the years from 1839 to
		1843 in England and in 1840 published 
		<title>Missionary Labours</title> which went through four editions in
		three years. This and other works such as 
		<title>Rivers of Water in a Dry Place</title> (1863) made him the best
		known missionary in Britain. It was while he was in England that he met David
		Livingstone and secured him for the Bakwana mission. Livingstone married
		Moffat's daughter Mary in 1844. Failing health or, as Moffat himself put it, an
		'over-taxed brain' compelled him 'to return to the land of his fathers' in 1870
		and he settled in London. Moffat's wife died in 1871, but he remained active
		promoting foreign missions and raising funds for a seminary at Kuruman Station
		to train Africans for missionary work. Criticised by some as paternalistic and
		as lacking a deep understanding of African culture, Moffat was, nevertheless,
		one of the pioneers of the missionary movement in Southern Africa. He was made
		a D.D. of Edinburgh University in 1872 and died in 1883 in Leigh, Kent,
		England. </p>
