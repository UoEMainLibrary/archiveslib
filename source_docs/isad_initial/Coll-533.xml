		<p>Robert Whytt was born in Edinburgh on 6 September 1714. He studied at
		  St. Andrews University where he was awarded an M.A. in 1730, then he studied
		  medicine at Edinburgh University. In 1734 he went to London to study and also
		  attended lectures in Paris and Leiden. In 1736 he took the degree of M.D. at
		  Rheims and in 1737 received a similar one from St. Andrews. In 1738 he became a
		  Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, and began practicing as
		  a physician. In 1747, Whytt was appointed Professor of the Theory of Medicine
		  at Edinburgh University, and in 1756 he also gave lectures on chemistry in
		  place of Professor John Rutherford (1695-1779). His publications include 
		<title>On the virtues of lime-water in the cure of stone </title> (1743),
		
		<title>On the vital and other involuntary motions of animals</title>
		(1751), and 
		<title>On nervous, hypochondriac, or hysteric diseases, to which are
		  prefixed some remarks on the sympathy of the nerves</title> (1764). In 1761 he
		was made the first Physician to the King in Scotland, and in 1763 he was
		elected President of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. Professor
		Robert Whytt died in Edinburgh on 15 April 1766.</p>
