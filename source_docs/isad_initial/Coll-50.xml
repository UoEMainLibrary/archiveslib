		<p>Poet and author George Mackay Brown was born in Stromness, Orkney, 17
		  October 1921 where he lived much of his life. He attended Edinburgh University
		  as a mature student in the late-1950s after preparatory studies at Newbattle
		  Abbey College, near Edinburgh. George Mackay Brown believed that his place as a
		  writer was at the heart of the community into which he was born, but although
		  his work is confined in place it has a broad range, from plays, children's
		  books, essays, to novels and short stories. It is for his novels though that he
		  is most famous, 
		<title>Greenvoe </title> 1972), 
		<title>Magnus </title> (1973), 
		<title>Beside the ocean of time </title> (1994). Short stories have
		included 
		<title>A calendar of love </title> (1967) and 
		<title>A time to keep </title>. Poetry has included 
		<title>Loaves and fishes </title> (1959), 
		<title>The year of the whale </title> (1968), and 
		<title>The wreck of the Archangel </title> (1995), the latter which
		earned him a Booker Prize short list citation in 1994 and the Saltire Scottish
		Book of the Year Award, 1995. George Mackay Brown died in Kirkwall, Orkney, 13
		April 1996 </p>
