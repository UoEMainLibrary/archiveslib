		<p>The entomologist Eleanor Anne Ormerod was born at Sedbury,
		  Glocestershire, in 1828. She was the third daughter of the antiquary and
		  historian George Ormerod (1785-1873), and sister of the geologist George
		  Wareing Ormerod (1810-1891). She was educated at home and she devoted her life
		  to the study of entomology. Ormerod chiefly investigated methods for the
		  prevention of the ravages of insects harmful to plant life. She was a
		  consultant entomologist to the Royal Agricultural Society, and she served as an
		  Additional Examiner in Agricultural Entomology at Edinburgh University. Her
		  publications include 
		<title>Report of observations of attack of turnip fly in 1881</title>
		(1882), 
		<title>Manual of injurious insects with methods of prevention and remedy
		  for their attacks to food crops, forest trees and fruit: to which is appended a
		  short introduction to entomology</title> (1890), 
		<title>Paris-green (or Emerald-green): its uses, and methods for its
		  application, as a means of destruction of orchard moth caterpillars</title>
		(1891), 
		<title>Handbook of insects injurious to orchards and bush fruits with
		  means of prevention and remedy</title> (1898), and 
		<title>Flies injurious to stock : being life-histories and means of
		  prevention of a few kinds commonly injurious, with special observations on ox
		  warble or bot fly</title> (1900). Ormerod was the first woman to have an
		honorary degree conferred by Edinburgh University. She received the
		University's honorary Doctorate of Laws in 1900. Eleanor A. Ormerod died on 19
		July 1901.</p>
