		<p>An appeal was launched in September 1970 to raise funds for the
		  celebration the following year of the bicentenary of the birth of Mungo Park
		  (1771-1806). The Committee was chaired by Professor G. A. Shepperson, Chair of
		  Commonwealth and American History at Edinburgh University.</p> 
		<p>The explorer Dr. Mungo Park was born at Foulshiels, near Selkirk, in
		  1771. After studying medicine at Edinburgh University, Park was appointed as
		  assistant surgeon on an expedition to Sumatra during which he collected
		  botanical and other scientific specimens. On his return he was appointed by the
		  Africa Association to lead an expedition to find the source of the River Niger.
		  He was only 24 when the journey from The Gambia began. His journey through
		  unmapped and unexplored territory took 18 months, and his journal was published
		  as 
		<title>Travels into the interior of Africa</title>. On his return to
		Scotland he carried on life as a doctor, but in 1804 Africa drew him back to
		head a new expedition to the Niger. Dr. Mungo Park died in 1806 in Bussa
		(Nigeria) when his boat was lost in the rapids there.</p>
