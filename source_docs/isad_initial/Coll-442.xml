		<p>Montrose with a population of 11,467 (1997, mid-year estimates) is one
		  of the main towns within Angus Council, in the east of Scotland. Its name is
		  derived from the Gaelic, Alt-moine-ros, meaning 'the burn of the mossy point'.
		  In 1296, in a long destroyed castle in the town - or at Stracathro near
		  Montrose - John Balliol surrendered Scotland to Edward I of England. The castle
		  was razed by William Wallace in 1297 and not rebuilt. As a Royal Burgh the
		  harbour town prospered through trading links, and in the nineteenth century the
		  principal economic activity was flax-spinning and linen manufacture, and most
		  trade was with Canada and the Baltic. Latterly most maritime activity has been
		  connected with the North Sea oil and gas industry.</p>

		  ledger book of John Doers, a merchant in Montrose, 1717-1746; mention of a
		  scheme for building a bridge over the River South Esk in a letter of D.
		  Carnegie, 1780; subscription of Pounds 21 towards the building of the New
