		<p>Mining in Germany has a long history. German mining knowledge and
		  practice in the late medieval period marked the beginning of European metal
		  mining and it was the discovery of rich silver ores in particular that prompted
		  innovation in mining and processing.</p> 
		<p>Saxony was the main mining area in the German states from the
		  fourteenth century onwards, with the Erzgebirge (the Ore Mountains) producing
		  large amounts of silver, lead and tin. The city of Freiberg grew and prospered
		  on the industry. Contributing to the success of Saxony as a mining region was
		  the early use of four-wheeled vehicles travelling on parallel wooden planks,
		  and later iron-capped wooden rails, then iron rails.</p> 
		<p>Another significant mining resource in Saxony was coal, and also brown
		  coal or lignite mined in the area around Leipzig.</p> 
		<p>Uranium mines and mills occur in southern Saxony along the
		  German-Czech border, and around Dresden and Chemnitz.</p> 
		<p>Freiberg is still home to a mining academy and teaching mine. </p>

	 <scopecontent> 
		<p>The material is composed of papers on mining in the district of
		  Freiberg, Saxony.</p>
