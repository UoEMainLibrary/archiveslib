		<p>Sir Richard Maitland, Lord Lethington, was born in 1496. He was
		  educated at St. Andrews University and then studied law in Paris. Subsequently
		  he was in the service of King James V and then in the service of his Queen,
		  Mary of Guise. On the return to Scotland of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1561,
		  Maitland - now blind - was admitted as a Lord of Session, a member of the Privy
		  Council, and Keeper of the Great Seal. His son William Lethington (c.
		  1528-1573) was Secretary to Mary. In addition to being a lawyer, Maitland was a
		  poet and collector of early Scottish poetry. His poems provide insight to the
		  events and customs of the period and include 
		<title>Satire on town ladies</title>. He also published 
		<title>Cronicle and historie of the house of and surname of
		  Seaton</title>. Sir Richard Maitland, Lord Lethington, died on 20 March 1586.
