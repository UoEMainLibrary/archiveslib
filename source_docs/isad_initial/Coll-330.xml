		<p>The Dutch mathematician, astronomer and physicist Christiaan Huygens
		  was born in The Hague on 14 April 1629. His father was the diplomat, Latinist
		  and poet Constantijn Hugens (1596-1687), friend and correspondent of Descartes
		  (1596-1650) and many other intellectuals of the time. Showing an early talent
		  for mechanics, drawing and mathematics, Huygens entered the University of
		  Leiden in 1645 studying mathematics and law. In 1647 he was studying in Breda,
		  and in 1655 came a first visit to Paris. By then, he had established a European
		  reputation through his scientific publications, and just before a second visit
		  to Paris in 1660 where he met Blaise Pascal (1623-1662), he discovered the true
		  shape of the rings of Saturn. This discovery in 1659 built on his earlier
		  discovery of a satellite of Saturn in 1655 and the stellar components of the
		  Orion nebula in 1656. Huygens also discovered the pendulum as a regulator of
		  clocks, describing this in 
		<title>Horologium</title> (1658). From 1666 to 1681, he lived in Paris,
		and in 1666 he was one of the founding members of the French Academy of
		Sciences. In France, he made the acquaintance of German mathematician and
		philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz (1646-1716). Illness prompted him to
		return to the Netherlands in 1681 and the subsequent revocation in 1685 of the
		Edict of Nantes (which had allowed Protestants certain liberties in France)
		prevented him from ever returning to Paris. In 1689, Huygens visited London,
		meeting Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727) and lecturing on his own theory of
		gravitation. Although his theory of gravitation was never taken seriously, his
		work on rotating bodies and his contributions to the theory of light have been
		of lasting importance. Other publications include 
		<title>De circuli magnitudine inventa</title> (1654), 
		<title>Horologium oscillatorium</title> (1673), 
		<title>Discourse on the cause of gravity</title> (1690), and 
		<title>Treatise on light</title> (1690). Christiaan Huygens died in The
		Hague on 8 July 1695.</p>
