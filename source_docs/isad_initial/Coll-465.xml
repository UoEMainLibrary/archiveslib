		<p>Robert Ranken or Rankin had studied at Cambridge University and was
		  elected as Regent (Professor) of Philosophy at Edinburgh University in 1625. He
		  was installed in November 1625. In the 1630s when a new prayer book and liturgy
		  was introduced to the Church of Scotland, modelled on that of the Church of
		  England, the National Covenant was revived against episcopacy and for the
		  restoration of the Presbyterian model. Ranken however was one of the few
		  professors within the University who did not bind himself to the Covenant, and
		  he soon incurred the displeasure of the Covenanters. In September1638 Robert
		  Ranken was forced to resign his Chair.</p>
