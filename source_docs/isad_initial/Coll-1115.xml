		<head>Administrative/Biographical History</head> 
		<p>The son of a veterinary surgeon, James Roland Rider was born in
		  N.E.England in 1894. He was educated at St. Bees, Cumbria, and at Newcastle
		  Royal Grammar School. In 1912 he went to Edinburgh to study at the Royal (Dick)
		  Veterinary College but in 1914 the outbreak of war interrupted his studies.
		  Rider enlisted in the Scots Greys and he served at Gallipoli. In 1916 he
		  returned to the Dick Vet', and graduated with the MRCVS in 1917. He then
		  re-enlisted, serving as a Captain in the Royal Army Veterinary Corps until the
		  end of the Great War.</p> 
		<p>From 1919 he was employed as a vet by Pease and Partners Ltd. owners
		  of several mines in the coalfields of Durham and Teeside. In 1928 he declined
		  the offer of a Lectureship at the Royal (Dick) Veterinary College, only to
		  suffer a cut in working hours the following year due to the Depression which
		  began in 1929. In 1930 however, Rider began his own private practice in
		  Darlington.</p> 
		<p>In 1932 he published a paper on 'Hypertrophy and diverticulae in the
		  ileum in pit ponies' for the 
		<title>Veterinary record</title>, British Veterinary Association.</p> 
		<p>James Roland Rider died of pulmonary tuberculosis on 19 November
		  1942.</p>
