		<p>Philip Kelland was born in Dunster, Somerset, in 1808. He studied at
		  Queens' College, Cambridge, graduating with a BA in 1834, and MA in 1837. He
		  was appointed Professor of Mathematics and Edinburgh University in 1838. The
		  first Englishman educated entirely in England to be appointed to a Chair at the
		  University, he came to identify himself completely with the Scottish university
		  system and actively participated in the movement for reform of that system. In
		  1839 he became a Fellow of Royal Society of Edinburgh and in 1852 he was chosen
		  as a member of the Society of Arts of Edinburgh. In addition to his devotion to
		  pure mathematics, Kelland wrote in the physical sciences - on the motion of
		  waves in canals, and on optics. His publications include 
		<title>Memoir on the limits of our knowledge respecting the theory of
		  parallels</title>, 
		<title>Theory of heat</title> (1837), 
		<title>The elements of algebra</title> (1839), 
		<title>The Scottish university system suited to the people</title>
		(1854), 
		<title>Elements of geometry</title> (1859), 
		<title>The Scottish school system suited to the people </title> (1870),
		and 
		<title>Lessons on physics</title> (1872). Philip Kelland died at Bridge
		of Allan on 7 May 1879.</p>
