		<p>John Cumming was born in Fintray, Aberdeenshire on 10 November 1807.
		  He was educated in Aberdeen and studied at Aberdeen University, graduating in
		  1827. He was licensed to preach by the Aberdeen Presbytery in 1832 and while
		  tutoring in London was invited to preach at the National Scottish Church at
		  Crown Court, Covent Garden (Crown Court Church Of Scotland, Russell Street).
		  His preaching attracted a large congregation to the small church and by 1847 a
		  larger one could be built. He used church income to fund schools in London. In
		  pamphlets and letters, Cumming opposed those who went on to form the Free
		  Church. The Rev. John Cumming died in London on 5 July 1881, and he was buried
		  at Kensal Green.</p>
