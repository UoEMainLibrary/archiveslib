		<p>The Cheshire antiquary and historian George Ormerod was born in High
		  Street, Manchester, on 20 October 1785. He attended King's School, Chester,
		  then was educated privately by the Rev. Thomas Bancroft at Bolton-le-Moors,
		  Lancashire. He studied at Brasenose College, Oxford. Early in his life he
		  became interested in heraldry and topography, and from around 1808 he began to
		  form large collections on the history of Cheshire. Ormerod's publications
		  include 
		<title>The history of the County Palatine and City of Chester</title>
		(1816), 
		<title>Parentalia: genealogical memoirs</title> (1851), and 
		<title>Remarks on a line of earth-works in Tidenham, known as Offa's
		  Dyke</title> (1859). Later in his life Ormerod became blind and he died at
		Sedbury Park, Gloucestershire, on 9 October 1873.</p>

		<p>The papers consist of original sketches, mainly by Ormerod, of
		  landscapes and buildings in Great Britain done during the first half of the
		  19th century.</p>
