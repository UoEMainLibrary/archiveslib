		<p>James Hogarth Pringle was born in Paramatta, New South Wales, in 1863.
		  He was the son of a well-known Sydney surgeon, George Hogarth Pringle. Pringle
		  graduated in medicine in 1885 from Edinburgh University. After House Surgeon's
		  posts in Edinburgh, Glasgow and London, he made a European Grand Tour and
		  studied further in Berlin, Vienna and Heidelberg. He returned to Glasgow and by
		  1888 was assisting William Macewen (1848-1924). In 1896 he was appointed
		  surgeon to the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, a post which he held until his
		  retirement in 1923. He became a Fellow of the Royal Faculty of Physicians and
		  Surgeons of Glasgow in 1899 and was Visitor from 1923 to 1924. His book 
		<title>Fractures and their Treatment</title> (1910) was one of the first
		to be based on treatment with radiological control. James Hogarth Pringle died
		in 1941.</p>
