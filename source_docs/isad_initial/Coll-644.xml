		<p>The poet Frederic James (Deric Bolton) Bolton was born in Paisley in
		  1908. He was educated at Shewsbury and studied at Birkbeck College, London
		  University. He was a research chemist as well as a poet, and worked as a
		  Technical Director with the firm of J. F. Macfarlane and Co. Ltd., in
		  Edinburgh, 1937 to 1962. Bolton was Convener of the Edinburgh Frontier Group,
		  Vice-Chair of the Scottish Association for Speaking of Verse, 1970-1973, and
		  Chair of the Edinburgh section of the Society of Chemical Industry, 1951 to
		  1953, and 1972 to 1974. His work includes 
		<title>A view from Benmore</title> (1972), 
		<title>Glasgow Central Station</title> (1972), 
		<title>The wild uncharted country: a scientific pilgrimage</title>
		(1973), and 
		<title>Grown over with greenness</title> (1976). Bolton has made
		excellent use of the scientific viewpoint in his poetry and 
		<title>My Uncle Eustace, maker of rings</title> (published in 
		<title>Nature</title> in 1977) was said to be likely <emph
		render="bold">the</emph> poem in English <emph render="bold">by</emph> a
		scientist <emph render="bold">about</emph> a scientist. Frederic James (Deric
		Bolton) Bolton died in 1993.</p>
