		<p>James Mackenzie was born at Picstonhill Farm, near Scone, on 4 April
		  1853. He attended the village school in Scone and then, from the age of twelve
		  until he was fifteen, Perth Academy. On leaving school he took up an
		  apprenticeship at the chemist's shop of Messrs Reid and Donald in George
		  Street, Perth. At the age of twenty he was offered a partnership in the firm
		  but turned it down in order to study medicine. In October 1874 he entered
		  Edinburgh University and completed his studies in 1878 with the degrees of
		  Bachelor of Medicine and Master in Surgery. After graduation he took up duties
		  at a colliery practice in Spennymoor, Co. Durham and then at Crooke, Co. Durham
		  and later in1878 worked briefly as House Physician and Assistant to Professors
		  of Clinical Medicine at the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh. From 1879 until 1907
		  Mackenzie was in medical practice in Burnley. In 1882 he was awarded the degree
		  of Doctor of Medicine from Edinburgh University, the subject of his thesis
		  being 
		<title>Clinical report of a case of Hemi-paraplegia Spinalis </title>. In
		1907, he left Burnley for a consulting practice in London. In 1918, Mackenzie
		left London for St. Andrews, establishing the Institute for Clinical Research.
		His publications include 
		<title>The study of the pulse </title> (1902), 
		<title>Diseases of the heart </title> (1908), 
		<title>Symptoms and their interpretation </title> (1909), 
		<title>Principles of diagnosis and treatment </title> (1916), 
		<title>The future of medicine </title> (1919), and 
		<title>Heart disease and pregnancy </title> (1923). Mackenzie was the
		Consulting Physician to King George V in Scotland, and Consulting Physician to
		the London Hospital. He was knighted in 1915. Sir James Mackenzie died on 25
		January 1925. </p>
