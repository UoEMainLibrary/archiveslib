		<p>Andrew Duncan was born at Pinkerton, near St. Andrews on 17 October
		  1744. His father was a merchant and shipmaster at Crail and then St. Andrews.
		  The young Andrew was educated in Crail and then in St. Andrews, and he studied
		  at St. Andrews University obtaining an M.A. in 1762. That same year he entered
		  Edinburgh University as a medical student. During his studies, in 1764, he
		  became President of the Royal Medical Society.</p> 
		<p>On completion of his studies in 1768, Duncan went to China as a ship's
		  surgeon for the East India Company. On his return in 1769 he graduated with the
		  degree of M.D. at St. Andrews University. In 1770, he became a Licentiate of
		  the Royal College of Physicians, Edinburgh, and the same year he tried
		  unsuccessfully for a professorship in St. Andrews. However, when Dr. Drummond
		  the elected-Professor of Medicine at Edinburgh University fell ill, during his
		  absence Duncan was appointed to lecture there from 1774. When Drummond failed
		  to return, he was elected Professor.</p> 
		<p>Duncan then began a public dispensary which later became the Royal
		  Public Dispensary. In 1789, he was appointed to the Chair of the Institutes of
		  Medicine (physiology) and in 1790 he became President of the Royal College of
		  Physicians.</p> 
		<p>Moved by the death of the poet Robert Ferguson (1750-1774), Duncan was
		  instrumental in the foundation of Edinburgh Lunatic Asylum, the building of
		  which was begun in 1809 (In 1922 it became the Royal Edinburgh Hospital for
		  Mental and Nervous Disorders, and today is known simply as the Royal Edinburgh
		  Hospital).</p> 
		<p>In 1819, Andrew Duncan junior (1773-1832) was appointed to assist him
		  in his Professorship, and in 1821 he became the first Physician to the King (or
		  Queen) in Scotland. That same year he became President of the Edinburgh
		  Medico-Chirurgical Society.</p> 
		<p>During his career, Duncan began publication of the quarterly 
		<title>Medical and philosophical commentaries</title> (1773-1795) which
		went on to become 
		<title>Annals of medicine</title>, and he also published 
		<title>Elements of therapeutics</title> (1770), 
		<title>The new dispensatory</title> (1786), and 
		<title>Observations on the distinguishing symptoms of three different
		  species of pulmonary consumption</title> (1813).</p> 
		<p>Professor Andrew Duncan died on 5 July 1828. </p>

		  correspondence, including: lectures on the theory and practice of medicine;
		  lectures on the practice of physic, 1778; extracts from lectures on the theory
		  of physic, 1777-1778; notes of lectures on the theory and practice of physic,
		  1797; lectures on the practice of medicine, 1785-1786, and 1785-1790; notes of

		  observations on medical jurisprudence, 1797-1798, and 1800; a short view of the

		  Gardiner, 1784; letter to C. Stewart, 1814; letter to J. Cumming, 1781; and, a
