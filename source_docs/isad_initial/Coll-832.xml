		<p>Hector Clare Cameron was born in Demerara (in Guyana), on 30 September
		  1843. He was the son of Donald Cameron a sugar-planter at Plantation Zeelugt,
		  Demerara (Dutch Guiana, now Guyana). He studied at St. Andrews, Edinburgh and
		  Glasgow Universities. Cameron was President of the faculty of Physicians and
		  Surgeons of Glasgow. Latterly he was Emeritus Professor of Clinical Surgery,
		  University of Glasgow, and Dean of Faculties at the University of Glasgow. He
		  was knighted in 1900 and received the CBE in 1918. Sir Hector Clare Cameron
		  died on 22 November 1928.</p> 
	 </bioghist> 
	 <scopecontent> 
		<p>The letters are from Cameron to Miss Blackburn and one is concerned
		  with the training of male nurses (or lack of it other than in the military) and
		  how he 'cannot suggest any way in which a civilian can be trained as a nurse'.
		  Another mentions receiving a letter from Lord Lister, and another how he can
		  help get a lad into hospital to attend a deformity of the foot.</p>
