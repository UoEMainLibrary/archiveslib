		<p>In 1745, William Cleghorn, son of Hugh Cleghorn a merchant burgess of
		  Edinburgh, was appointed to the Chair of Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh
		  University on the resignation of physician Sir John Pringle (1707-1782).</p> 
		<p>Pringle had no particular taste for philosophy and had accepted an
		  appointment by Lord Stair, Commander of the British army, as his physician and
		  later physician to the military hospital in Flanders. When the Duke of
		  Cumberland appointed him Physician-General to the King's forces in the Low
		  Countries in 1744, Pringle resigned his Chair in Edinburgh.</p> 
		<p>While abroad, Pringle's classes had been taken by William Cleghorn.
		  However, wishing to raise the vacant Chair of Moral Philosophy, Edinburgh's
		  Town Council offered the professorship to Dr. Francis Hutcheson (1694-1746),
		  Professor of Moral Philosophy at Glasgow University and founder of the Scottish
		  school of philosophy, rather than offer it to Cleghorn. Hutcheson declined, and
		  David Hume (1711-1776) offered himself for the vacancy. Rather than give the
		  Chair to Hume who was 'deemed a Jacobite' and whose 'philosophical opinions
		  were a bar to his appointment', Cleghorn was elected to the Chair of Pneumatics
		  and Moral Philosophy on 5 June 1745 (Pneumatics - 'the being and perfections of
		  the one true God, the nature of the Angels and the soul of man, and the duties
		  of natural religion').</p> 
		<p>Professor William Cleghorn died in 1754.</p>
