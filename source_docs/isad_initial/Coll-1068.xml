		<head>Administrative/Biographical History</head> 
		<p>The mathematician, statistician, writer, composer and musician,
		  Alexander Craig Aitken, was born in Dunedin, New Zealand on 1 April 1895. He
		  was of Scottish descent. He attended Otago Boys' High School from 1908 to 1912.
		  On winning a university scholarship in 1912 he went on to study at the
		  University of Otago in 1913, enrolling in Mathematics, French and Latin.
		  Studies were cut short by the 1914-1918 War however and he enlisted in 1915
		  serving with the Otago Infantry. Aitken saw action in Gallipoli and Egypt, and
		  he was wounded during the Battle of the Somme. After his hospitalisation, he
		  returned to New Zealand in 1917.</p> 
		<p>On the completion of his studies in 1920, Aitken became a
		  school-teacher at Otago Boys' High School and the same year he married Winifred
		  Betts the first lecturer in Botany at the University of Otago where he also did
		  some tutoring. Then, encouraged by a professor of mathematics at the
		  University, he gained a postgraduate scholarship which brought him to Edinburgh
		  University in 1923. His thesis on statistics gained him the degree of D.Sc. in
		  1925 when he also joined the University staff as a lecturer in Statistics and
		  Mathematical Economics. In 1937 he was promoted to Reader, and in 1946 was
		  appointed to the Chair of Mathematics.</p> 
		<p> Aitken's publications include: jointly with H. W. Turnbull, 
		<title>The theory of canonical matrices</title> (1932); with D. E.
		Rutherford, a series of Mathematical Texts; wartime experiences in 
		<title>Gallipoli to the Somme: Recollections of a New Zealand
		  infantryman</title> (1963); and, posthumously 
		<title>To catch the spirit. The memoir of A.C. Aitken with a biographical
		  introduction by P.C. Fenton</title> (1995). He made many important
		contributions to the many fields of his subject, particularly in the theory of
		Matrix Algebra and its application to various branches of mathematics. In his
		time, Professor Aitken was one of the fastest mathematical calculators in the
		world.</p> 
		<p>While at school, Aitken had learned to play the violin, and later on
		  in life he played both the violin and viola and composed pieces for performance
		  by university groups.</p> 
		<p>Professor Alexander C. Aitken died in Edinburgh on 3 November
		  1967.</p>
