		<p>John Scott Haldane was born in Edinburgh in 1860. He was the brother
		  of statesman Richard Burdon Haldane (1856-1928), Viscount Haldane, and the
		  father of both geneticist John Burdon Sanderson Haldane (1892-1964) and writer
		  Naomi Mitchison (1897-1999). Haldane was educated at Edinburgh Academy and then
		  studied medicine at Edinburgh University and in Jena, Germany. He graduated in
		  1884 and took up a position at Queen's College, Dundee, before becoming a
		  Demonstrator in Physiology at Oxford University in 1887. There he lectured and
		  researched in medicine, and became Reader in 1907. In 1905 he established that
		  it was the high concentration of carbon dioxide in blood, not low
		  concentrations of oxygen, which regulated the breathing rate, and in 1907 he
		  developed stage decompression for bringing deep-divers to the surface, thus
		  avoiding 'the bends'. During the First World War he worked on the
		  identification of war-gases, and when he was Director of the Mining Research
		  Laboratory in Doncaster (1912-1936) he improved mine-safety. He demonstrated
		  the toxic effects of carbon monoxide and the use of rescue equipment, including
		  the development of the Haldane Equaliser Device. John Scott Haldane died in
		  March 1936 after research in Iran (then Persia) into heat stroke among oil
		  workers. </p>
