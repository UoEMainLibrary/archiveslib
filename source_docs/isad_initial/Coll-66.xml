		<p>The phonetician Professor David Abercrombie, son of poet Lascelles
		  Abercrombie, was born 19 December 1909. He can be considered as one of the
		  great phoneticians in the history of the discipline. Abercrombie was educated
		  at Leeds Grammar School, Leeds University, University College London, and the
		  Sorbonne. His first academic appointment as Assistant Lecturer in English at
		  the London School of Economics (LSE) was in 1934. He returned there after the
		  war, between 1945 and 1947. During the war, he worked in Athens, Cyprus, and
		  Cairo. After the LSE, he lectured in phonetics at Leeds University. In 1948
		  however, he joined Edinburgh University and spent 32 years there, as Lecturer,
		  Senior Lecturer, Reader, Professor of Phonetics (1964-80), and Emeritus
		  (1980-92). He was also Lecturer in Linguistics and Phonetics at Glasgow
		  University (1980-81). Abercrombie died in Edinburgh, 4 July 1992. He had lived
		  at 13 Grosvenor Crescent in the city. His main influence on the broader world
		  was his 
		<title>Elements of General Phonetics </title> (1967). Other works were 
		<title>Isaac Pitman: a pioneer in the scientific study of language
		  </title> (1937); 
		<title>Problems and principles in language study </title> (1956); 
		<title>English phonetic texts </title> (1964); and, 
		<title>Studies in phonetics and linguistics </title> (1965). Before his
		death, he passed other personal notes and papers to John Kelly who in turn
		passed these on to the Department of Linguistics and Phonetics at the
		University of Leeds. In 1999 arrangements were being made to house these in
		Leeds Brotherton Library's Special Collections. </p>
