		<p>Andrew John Young was born in 1885. He was a native of Elgin and was
		  educated at Edinburgh's Royal High School. He studied at Edinburgh University
		  and New College, gaining his MA in 1907. Young was ordained as a Minister of
		  the United Free Church of Scotland at Temple, Midlothian, but in 1939 he
		  entered the Church of England and became the Vicar of Stonegate, Sussex. In
		  1948, he was made Canon of Chichester Cathedral. In addition to his life as a
		  parson, Young was a poet and was interested in fine art and British wild
		  flowers. His publications of prose writing include 
		<title>A prospect of flowers</title> (1945), and 
		<title>A retrospect of flowers</title> (1950), and his poetry includes 
		<title>Winter harvest</title> (1933), 
		<title>The white blackbird</title> (1933), 
		<title>Into Hades</title> (1952), and 
		<title>Out of the world and back</title> (1958). He also wrote 
		<title>The poet and the landscape</title> (1962). He was awarded a silver
		medal by the Royal Society of Literature in 1940, and in 1944 he was an elected
		Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. In 1951 he received the honorary
		degree of Doctor of Laws from Edinburgh University. The Rev. Canon Andrew John
		Young died at Arundel on 25 November 1971.</p>
