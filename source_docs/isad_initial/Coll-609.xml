		<p>The Foreign Mission Committee (later Overseas Council then Board of
		  World Mission and Unity) of the Church of Scotland was responsible for the
		  Church's mission work around the world. In 1824 the Church's General Assembly
		  resolved to send its first missionary to India and appointed Alexander Duff who
		  arrived in Bombay in 1830. Other missionaries were sent to Calcutta (1830),
		  Poona (1834), and Madras (1837). The Disruption of 1843 which saw the
		  separation of the Free Church of Scotland from the main Church caused the loss
		  of most missionaries and the missionary spirit, as the work continued but under
		  the umbrella of the Free Church. The United Presbyterian Church, formed in
		  1847, inherited some existing missionaries in the West Indies and in Calabar,
		  Nigeria and by the 1870s was active in Jamaica, India, South Africa, Japan and
		  Manchuria, China. The Church of Scotland resumed its missionary work in 1857 in
		  the Punjab and in the 1870s established its first stations in Nyasaland
		  (Malawi, 1876) and China (1878). In 1900 the Free Church joined with the United
		  Presbyterians to form the United Free Church but remained separate from the
		  Church of Scotland. Co-operation between the two Churches was secured in some
		  areas, in India, for example, joint colleges were formed in Madras and
		  Calcutta. However it was not until 1929 that the Free Church and the Church of
		  Scotland joined as the Church of Scotland.</p>
