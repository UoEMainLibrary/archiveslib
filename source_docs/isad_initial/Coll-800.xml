		<p>The Outlook Tower is situated on Edinburgh's Castlehill (Castle Hill),
		  high on a ridge between Lawnmarket and the Castle Esplanade, at the top of the
		  Royal Mile in the Old Town. The building was formerly a town mansion, with its
		  bottom storeys dating from the 17th century and its castellated upper storeys
		  being added in 1853 when it was reconstructed as Short's Observatory - probably
		  by David Rhind (1801-1883). From that date, it housed a Camera Obscura on the
		  uppermost level.</p> 
		<p> In 1892, the Outlook Tower was acquired on a lease by Sir Patrick
		  Geddes (1854-1932) who had become involved in the renewal of the city's Old
		  Town. In 1896, the Tower was purchased by the Town and Gown Association, a body
		  formed to assist with the financial challenges met in the renewal of the Old
		  Town. The Tower was to be developed as a regional and sociological laboratory;
		  a centre for post-graduate studies, experimental education and civic
		  improvement. Geddes intended that the building should offer an interactive
		  experience and that it be a civic museum and educational resource. Summer
		  Schools and meetings were organised on such varied subjects as seaside and
		  garden biology, the theory of evolution, philosophy and art. The social
		  phenomena of the city were also observed. The Outlook Tower acted as a centre
		  for teaching, reference and study around all of these activities, and became a
		  civic and urban observatory or laboratory. Geddes believed that such a centre
		  for 'civic and social outlook' could be 'experimented with in any city' and
		  better still with 'the co-operative activity of a Current Events Club'.</p> 
		<p>Today, the Outlook Tower still houses a Camera Obscura and it is a
		  popular tourist attraction.</p>
