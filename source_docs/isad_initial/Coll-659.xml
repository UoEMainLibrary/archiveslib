		<p>Dudley Coutts Stuart was born in London on 11 January 1803. He studied
		  at Christ's College, Cambridge and graduated in 1823. He was elected as MP for
		  Arundel in 1830 and again in 1831, 1833, and 1835, and was MP for Marylebone
		  from 1847. From the 1830s, and after the visit to England by Prince Adam
		  Czartoryski in 1831 and his accounts of Russian Tsarist oppression in Poland,
		  Stuart became a strong advocate for Polish independence. He organised public
		  subscriptions and annual balls to supplement grants made by the House of
		  Commons to victims of Russian, Austrian and Prussian oppression at that time.
		  In 1854 he went to Sweden in the hope of gaining the support of King Oscar I in
		  joining western powers in the measures for the reconstruction of Poland. Lord
		  Dudley Coutts Stuart died in Stockholm on 17 November 1854 and was buried in
		  Hertford, England, on 16 December 1854.</p>
