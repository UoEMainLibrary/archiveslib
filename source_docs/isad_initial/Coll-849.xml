		<p>John Sinclair, the son of Sir John Sinclair (1754-1835), was born in
		  1797. He was educated at Edinburgh University and at Pembroke College, Oxford.
		  In Edinburgh he helped found the Rhetorical Society and at Oxford he promoted a
		  scheme which led to the formation of the Union Society. He was ordained as a
		  deacon in 1819 and then as a priest in 1820. He worked in Sutterby,
		  Lincolnshire, in Hackney, and in Edinburgh, before being appointed Secretary of
		  the National Society in 1839. Sinclair was the mover behind negotiations
		  between the Church and the Government which ended in an agreement in 1850
		  respecting the allocation of government money to elementary schools. In 1843 he
		  had become Vicar of Kensignton, and in 1844 Archdeacon of Middlesex. Rev. John
		  Sinclair died in Kensington on 22 May 1875.</p>
