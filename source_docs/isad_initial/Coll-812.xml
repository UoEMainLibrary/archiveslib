		<p>The British journalist James Nicol Dunn was born in Kincardineshire on
		  12 October 1856. He was educated in Aberdeen. He intended to follow a career in
		  law but writing for journals and magazines while still a student gave him a
		  taste for journalism and so instead he joined the staff of 
		<title>The Dundee advertiser</title> and later on 
		<title>The Scotsman</title>. He was managing editor of the 
		<title>Scots observer</title> and the 
		<title>National observer</title> under W. E. Henley, 1888-1893, then news
		editor of 
		<title>The Pall Mall gazette</title>, 1894. Dunn was then editor of 
		<title>Black and white</title> and 
		<title>The Ludgate monthly</title>, 1895-1897, before becoming editor of 
		<title>The Morning post</title> in 1897 and the 
		<title>Manchester courier</title> in 1905. In 1911 he was made editor of 
		<title>The star</title>, Johannesburg, and in 1914 London editor of 
		<title>The Glasgow evening news</title>. Dunn was President of the
		Institute of Journalists 1904. He died in Denmark Hill, London, on 30 June
		1919.</p>

		<p>The material is composed of two letters from Dunn at the Strand
		  offices of 
		<title>The Morning post</title> to Mrs. Franklin. In one he fears an
		inability to visit Scotland (1900) and indicates having the share of a farm on
		Dartmoor. In the other he offers thanks for a portrait of 'Dutch Baby' and
		refers to the children generally. </p>
