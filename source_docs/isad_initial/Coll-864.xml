		<p>Alexander Waugh was born at East Gordon, Berwickshire, on 16 August
		  1754. He was educated at the local village school and then later on at
		  Earlston, Berwickshire. In 1770 he began studies at Edinburgh University and
		  then in 1777 he went to Aberdeen University. Waugh was licensed by the
		  Presbytery of Edinburgh at Duns, Berwickshire, in June 1779, and the same year
		  he went to London to the Wells Street Congregational Church. A brief period
		  back in Scotland followed, at Melrose, before his return to London in 1782. In
		  addition to his work at Wells Street, he was on the original committee of the
		  London Missionary Society formed in 1795. In 1802 he went to France but that
		  mission was interrupted by war, although he made annual missionary tours
		  throughout the UK and to Ireland. In addition to many sermons, Waugh published 
		<title>Sermons, expositions, and addresses at the holy communion</title>
		(1825). The Rev. Alexander Waugh died on 14 December 1827.</p>

		<p>The material is composed of two letters written by Waugh from
		  Salisbury Place, Mary Bone, London. One is to the Rev. George Lawson D.D. and
		  refers to Waugh's son Alexander and to 'a testimonial of his good conduct in
		  London during the summer'. Waugh goes on to say that his 'attendance on divine
		  ordinances and his private behaviour, as far as known to me, has been regular
		  and correct. Let me earnestly commend him to your fatherly care and highest
		  counsels'. The other letter is to 'My dear and loved friend' and deals with an
		  appeal and various sums given.</p>
