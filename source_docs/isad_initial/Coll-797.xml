		  Asia Minor, 1856-1859. He explored the Cyrenaice (North Africa, ancient-Greek
		  Libya) and made successful excavations at Cyrene (now Shahhat, Libya),
		  1860-1861. Smith was Director of the Government Indo-European Telegraph
		  Department, Persian Section, and subsequently Director-in-Chief of the whole
		  Department, 1863-1885. He was sent on special duty to Persia (Iran) by the
		  Foreign Office in 1887. He was also Director of the Museum of Science and Art,
		  Edinburgh (now the Royal Museum of Scotland) and a member of the Board of
		  Trustees and Commissioners for Manufactures. Major-General Sir Robert Murdoch
