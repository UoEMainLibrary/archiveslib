		<p>James Richardson had been an Egyptologist. He died in 1877.</p> 
		<p>Egyptology is the study of pharaonic Egypt, spanning the period circa
		  4500 BC to AD 641. Egyptology began when the scholars accompanying Napoleon
		  Bonaparte's invasion of Egypt (1798-1801) published 
		<title>Description de l'Egypte</title> (1809-28), which made large
		quantities of source material about ancient Egypt available to European
		scholars.</p> 
		<p>Written Egyptian documents date to circa 3350 BC when the first
		  pharaohs developed a writing system employing characters in the form of
		  pictures. These individual signs, called hieroglyphs, may be read either as
		  pictures, as symbols for pictures, or as symbols for sounds. The name
		  'hieroglyphic' (from the Greek word for 'sacred carving') is first encountered
		  in the writings of Diodorus Siculus in the 1st century BC. </p> 
	 </bioghist> 
	 <scopecontent> 
		<p>The collection is composed of notes mainly on Egyptian hieroglyphics,
		  including studies for a dictionary of hieroglyphics. In addition to the volumes
		  and boxed notebooks there are a number of folded documents and miscellaneous
		  manuscripts.</p>
