		<p>The jurist Henry James Sumner Maine was born on 15 August 1822. His
		  childhood was spent in Jersey and in Henley-on-Thames. He was educated at
		  Christ's Hospital, London, and at Pembroke College, Cambridge. From 1845 to
		  1847 he was a Junior Tutor at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and in 1847 he became
		  Regius Professor of Civil Law. In 1850, Maine was called to the Bar and in 1852
		  became Reader in Roman Law and Jurisprudence at the Inns of Court. In 1862 he
		  was made a legal member of the Viceroy's Council of India, serving under Lord
		  Elgin, Lord Lawrence, and Lord Mayo. He returned to Britain in 1869 and became
		  Professor of Jurisprudence at Oxford University. Maine was knighted in 1871,
		  being awarded Knight Commander of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of India,
		  and he was given a seat on the Council of India. In 1877 he was chosen as
		  Master of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and in 1887 was appointed to the Chair of
		  International Law at Cambridge. His publications include 
		<title>Ancient law: its connection with the early history of society and
		  its relation to modern ideas</title> (1861), 
		<title>Village communities</title> (1871), 
		<title>Popular government</title> (1885), and 
		<title>International law</title> (1888). His 
		<title>Ancient law</title> was the starting point of the study of
		jurisprudence for some time afterwards. Sir Henry James Sumner Maine died in
		Cannes on 3 February 1888.</p>
