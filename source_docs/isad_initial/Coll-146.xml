	 <bioghist> 
		<p>In his writing, Arthur Koestler had examined the problems of political
		  idealism and power, as well as evolution, psychology, the history of science,
		  capital punishment, and the nature of artistic creation.</p> 
		<p>Koestler was born in Budapest, Hungary, 5 September 1905. He attended
		  the University of Vienna, 1922-26, before becoming a journalist. Between
		  1926-29, he worked on a farm in Palestine and as an architect's assistant, as
		  well as being an editor of a Cairo weekly. He became a foreign correspondent,
		  foreign editor, and science editor for a number of German publishing houses,
		  and in 1931 he was the only journalist on the Graf Zeppelin Arctic
		  expedition.</p> 
		<p>In 1931, Koestler became a member of the Communist Party and during
		  the 1930s he travelled in Central Asia and the Soviet Union. During the Spanish
		  Civil War, he served as a war correspondent and was imprisoned and sentenced to
		  death by the Fascists. Through the intervention of the British government he
		  was released, and his experience of this period was described in 
		<title>Spanish testament</title> (1937). His break with the Communist
		Party at the time of the Moscow Trials was the background to 
		<title>Darkness at noon</title> (1938). That same year, he became editor
		of 
		<title>Zukunft</title>.</p> 
		<p>On the outbreak of war in 1939, Koestler was imprisoned in France but
		  was released in 1940. He then escaped to England where he worked for the
		  Ministry of Information, the BBC, and as a night ambulance driver. From 1940,
		  Koestler wrote in English. He became a British citizen in 1948. Works of
		  fiction during this period, include 
		<title>The gladiators</title> (1939) and 
		<title>Arrival and departure</title> (1943), both of which deal with
		questions of morality and political responsibility. His essays are collected in
		
		<title>The yogi and the commissar and other essays</title> (1945) and 
		<title>The god that failed</title> (1949). His last political work,
		examining the dilemma of Europe after the Second World War, was 
		<title>The age of longing</title> (1951).</p> 
		<p>In 
		<title>Arrow in the blue</title> (1952) and 
		<title>The invisible writing</title> (1954), Koestler took stock of his
		life, and then in his later works he tackled scientific and philosophical
		matters. 
		<title>The act of creation</title> (1964) was perhaps the best known work
		of this period. Others include 
		<title>The lotus and the robot</title> (1960) examining Eastern
		mysticism; 
		<title>The ghost in the machine</title> (1967) looking at the effect of
		evolution on the human brain; and, 
		<title>The thirteenth tribe</title> a study of the origins of the Jewish
		people (1976). Towards the end of his life a collection of his writings with a
		new commentary appeared, 
		<title>Bricks to Babel</title> (1981).</p> 
		<p>Koestler had suffered from leukaemia and Parkinson's disease, and as
		  believers in voluntary euthanasia he and his wife Cynthia took their own lives
		  in 1983. Koestler's death was reported on 3 March 1983. </p> 
	 </bioghist> 
	 <scopecontent> 
		<p>The archive consists of inscribed and annotated books from Koestler's
		  library, along with English-language editions and translations of his work into
		  many languages; and Koestler's manuscripts and papers from 1940 to March 1983.
		  The archive contains correspondence with or about members of Koestler's family;
		  personal material including diaries, address books, medical files and other
		  personal documents; literary manuscripts including interviews, broadcasts and
		  speeches; correspondence with specific people; personal and fan correspondence;
		  material on specific subjects such as ESP and euthanasia; business and
		  financial papers; literary manuscripts by other authors, including those on
		  Koestler; cuttings, offprints, and pamphlets including articles both by
		  Koestler and on Koestler; non-print material such as photographs, tapes and
		  medals, and records; and, files gifted by publishers Hutchinson comprising of
		  papers and correspondence on particular books. Most of Koestler's earlier
		  papers were lost when France fell in 1940 and when he left for England. The
		  papers bequeathed in 1993 include personal files which are restricted until
		  2045; correspondence; reviews; royalty statements 1976-1993; contracts and
		  rights correspondence; personal financial material; and, correspondence on
		  wills, last message, sale of property, and winding up the estate.</p>

		<p>The Koestler Archive came to Edinburgh University Library in 1984
		  after the University accepted the offer of the Koestler Chair of
		  Parapsychology. Through the efforts of Harold Harris, Koestler's literary
		  executor, and the London Library to which Koestler had left his books, the
		  extensive archive was transferred to EUL's Special Collections department.
		  Other papers relating to Arthur Koestler were bequeathed by Harris in 1993.</p>
