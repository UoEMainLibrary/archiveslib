		<p>The University of Edinburgh was established by Royal Charter in 
		  <date type="single" normal="1582" certainty="certain"
			audience="external">1582</date>. It was originally called Tounis College, when
		  part of a legacy left by Robert Reid, Bishop of Orkney in 
		  <date type="single" normal="1558" certainty="certain"
			audience="external">1558</date> had established a college of which the Town
		  Council had gained control to establish a College of Law on the South side of
		  Edinburgh. The inception of the University took place in 
		  <date type="single" normal="1583" certainty="certain">1583</date>. In 
		  <date type="single" normal="1617" certainty="certain"
			audience="external">1617</date> when King James VI of Scotland (I of England)
		  visited the College it was decreed that the College should change its name to
		  King James' College, although the College continued to use the older title. The
		  first change in the corporate body of the University was not until 
		  <date type="single" normal="1935" certainty="certain"
		  audience="external">1935</date> when the first merger took place. This was
		  between the Faculty of Divinity of the University of Edinburgh and New College.
		  This was due to the re-union of the Church of Scotland in 
		  <date type="single" normal="1932" certainty="certain"
		  audience="external">1932.</date>The next merger was in 
		  <date type="single" normal="1951" certainty="certain"
		  audience="external">1951</date> when the Royal (Dick) Veterinary School was
		  reconstituted as part of the University of Edinburgh. The Royal (Dick)
		  Veterinary School achieved full faculty status in 
		  <date type="single" normal="1964" certainty="certain"
		  audience="external">1964.</date> In 
		  <date type="single" normal="1998" certainty="certain"
		  audience="external">1998</date> Moray House Institute of Education became the
		  Faculty of Education.</p> 
		<p>The first classes of the university were held in Hamilton House known
		  as the Duke's Lodge. In 
		  <date type="single" normal="1582" certainty="certain"
			audience="external">1582</date> a site that included St Mary in the Fields was
		  acquired. Many new buildings and extensions were made to the site of Hamilton
		  House after 
		  <date type="single" normal="1616" certainty="certain"
			audience="external">1616.</date> Two prominent stages of building for the
		  University were those undertaken by Robert Adam and William Playfair. In 
		  <date type="single" normal="1869" certainty="certain"
			audience="external">1869 </date>the site next to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary
		  was acquired. Building on this project was completed by the end of the 
		  <date type="inclusive" normal="1800/1899" certainty="circa"
			audience="external">19th century</date>. The University today is situated
		  around these areas in the centre of Edinburgh and Kings Buildings and there are
		  also campuses at Holyrood and elsewhere.</p> 
		<p>Teaching began in 
		  <date type="single" normal="1583" certainty="certain"
			audience="external">1583</date> under Robert Rollock, with a four year course
		  in arts to gain a masters of arts. When Rollock was appointed as the first
		  principal of the University, there were four Philosophy regents and one regent
		  of Humanity, whilst Rollock specialized in Divinity. Until the beginning of the
		  
		  <date type="inclusive" normal="1700/1799" certainty="circa"
			audience="external">18th century</date> the University remained essentially an
		  Arts College, with a Divinity School attached. Throughout the 
		  <date type="inclusive" normal="1600/1699" certainty="circa"
			audience="external">17th century</date> the Chairs of Divinity, Oriental
		  Languages, Ecclesiastical History and Mathematics had been created. By the end
		  of the 17th century there was also regular teaching in Medicine, and sporadic
		  teaching in Law. The University was at the centre of European Enlightenment in
		  the 
		  <date type="inclusive" normal="1700/1799" certainty="circa"
			audience="external">18th century</date>. By 
		  <date type="single" normal="1722" certainty="certain"
			audience="external">1722</date> a Faculty of Law had been established. The
		  first medical Chair had been established in 
		  <date type="single" normal="1685" certainty="certain"
			audience="external">1685</date> and was closely followed in the 
		  <date type="inclusive" normal="1700/1750" certainty="circa">first half
			 of the 18th century</date> by six more. Four more medical Chairs were created
		  in the 
		  <date type="inclusive" normal="1800/1899" certainty="circa"
			audience="external">19th century</date>. New Chairs in other Faculties were not
		  established after 
		  <date type="single" normal="1760" certainty="certain"
			audience="external">1760</date> until the 
		  <date type="inclusive" normal="1850/1899" certainty="circa"
			audience="external">latter half of the 19th century</date> when they followed
		  in rapid succession, continuing in the 
		  <date type="inclusive" normal="1900/1999" certainty="circa"
			audience="external">20th century</date>, which include those produced by the
		  mergers with New College, the Royal (Dick) Veterinary School and Moray House
		  Institute of Education.</p> 
		<p>The University was governed by the town council until the Universities
		  (Scotland) Act of 
		  <date type="single" normal="1858" certainty="certain"
			audience="external">1858</date>, when it received self governing status. The
		  archaic teaching and management system of regents was abolished in 
		  <date type="single" normal="1708" certainty="certain"
			audience="external">1708</date>. The 
		  <date type="single" normal="1858" certainty="certain"
			audience="external">1858</date> act dramatically changed the constitution of
		  the University. A University Court and General Council were introduced which
		  decided on matters and management pertaining to the whole University. The
		  Senatus Academicus was already in place before 
		  <date type="single" normal="1858" certainty="certain"
			audience="external">1858</date>and this managed academic matters, but answered
		  to the Court and Council. This system is still used.</p> 
		<p>The University of Edinburgh provides validation for a Master of Fine
		  Arts that has run jointly with Edinburgh College of Art since 
		  <date type="single" normal="1943" certainty="certain"
			audience="external">1943</date>. A joint chair, the Hood Chair of Mining
		  Engineering was established in 
		  <date type="single" normal="1923" certainty="certain"
			audience="external">1923</date> with Heriot-Watt College which became
		  Heriot-Watt University.</p> 
		<p>In 
		  <date normal="2002" certainty="certain">2002</date>, the structure of
		  the university was altered substantially, with the abolition of Faculties and
		  the creation of the College of Humanities &amp; Social Science, the College of
		  Medicine &amp; Veterinary Medicine and the College of Science &amp;
		  Engineering. Departments were replaced by Schools within each Faculty.</p>

			 <p>From the early 17th century, the governing body of the University
				of Edinburgh was the Senatus Academicus. By Act of Parliament this was
				transferred to the University Court in 1889. The Court had come into existence
				following the Act of 1858 but from 1889 it became a body corporate, with
				perpetual succession and a common seal.</p> 
			 <p>The current positions of Rector, Chancellor and Principal &amp;
				Vice Chancellor also stem from the 1858 Act, as does the General Council which
				elects the Chancellor and four Assessors on the Court. The Curators of
				Patronage continue the link between the university and the city, though their
				powers are now largely formal.</p>

				<head>Administrative History</head> 
				<p>The Court of the University of Edinburgh was formed at the end
				  of 
				  <date audience="external" type="single" normal="1859"
					certainty="certain">1859</date>, after the passing of the Universities (
				  Scotland) Act, 
				  <date audience="external" type="single" normal="1858"
					certainty="certain">1858</date>. It consisted of the Lord Rector, his assessor,
				  the Chancellor's assessor, Principal, Lord Provost, Town Council's assessor,
				  University Council's assessor and an assessor elected by the Senatus
				  Academicus. The Court functions at this time were to revise, on appeal, the
				  acts of the Senatus, to sanction the expenditure by the Senatus of University
				  funds and generally to take a supervision of the professors. The Commissioners
				  of the 
				  <date audience="external" type="single" normal="1858"
				  certainty="certain">1858</date> Act performed many of these functions until
				  their dispersal.</p> 
				<p>By the Universities (Scotland) Act, 
				  <date audience="external" type="single" normal="1889"
				  certainty="certain">1889</date>, the University Court became a body corporate,
				  with perpetual succession and a common seal; and all the property belonging to
				  the University at the passing of the Act was now vested in that body. The
				  present powers of the Court, which include among others, the amendment of the
				  composition, powers and functions of the bodies in the University, and the
				  creation of new bodies, the administration and management of the whole revenue
				  and property of the University, internal arrangements of the University,
				  appointments, review of decisions of the Senatus, and, on recommendation of the
				  Senatus, the regulation of degrees and administration and discipline of
				  students, are defined in the Universities (Scotland) Act, 
				  <date audience="external" type="single" normal="1966"
				  certainty="certain">1966</date>.</p> 
				<p>The Court now also includes three assessors elected by the
				  General Council, four Senatus assessors, one assesor elected by members of the
				  non-teaching staff, two fully-matriculated students nominated by the Students'
				  Representative Council and eight co-opted members. The Rector is the President
				  of the Court. The Vice-Chairman of the Court is elected triennially by the
				  Court from among its members. Meetings are normally held seven times a
				  year.</p>

				  from Edinburgh Town Council to the Senatus Academicus, the University Court in

				  consists of the Principal, the professors, heads of departments, and a number
				  of readers, lecturers and other teaching and research staff.</p> 
				<p>The Senatus Academicus superintends and regulates the teaching
				  and discipline of the University and has the power to promote research. The
				  Senatus elects four assessors, of whom at least one must be a professor and at
				  least one a non-professorial member of the teaching staff, to the University
				  Court. Degrees are conferred on the recommendation of the Senatus, by the
				  Chancellor, the Vice Chancellor, the Principal, a Vice Principal, or senior
				  professor present. The Principal is President of the Senatus, with deliberative
				  and also a casting vote. There are thirteen student Associate Members. The
				  Senatus meets six times annually.</p>

				</did> 
				<bioghist encodinganalog="isadg(2)322" audience="external"> 
				  <p>Masson Hall was opened as a residence for women students at
					 the University of Edinburgh in 1897. The residence, located at 31 George
					 Square, was built through funding generated by a campaign led by the Edinburgh
					 Association for the University Education of Women to provide amenities for the
					 female students of the University.</p> 
				  <p>The Edinburgh Association for the University Education of
					 Women, previously known as the Edinburgh Ladies Education Association, was
					 founded in 1867 to promote the education and intellectual improvement of women.
					 By campaigning for the university education of women the association
					 established close links with the institution, finding support for their cause
					 in many of its professor's. One of the most outspoken in support for the
					 campaign was David Masson, Professor of Rhetoric and English Literature at
					 Edinburgh University who gave lectures in English Literature for women through
					 classes put on by the association.</p> 
				  <p>The Universities (Scotland) Act 1889 was produced as a result
					 of the widespread women's movement. The act appointed commissioners to draw up
					 ordinances relating to various aspects of the University system. The Ordinance
					 no.18 (Regulations for the Graduation of Women and for their instruction in the
					 Universities) was passed in 1892 with the first female students graduating in
					 1893 as a result of accreditation given to attendance of the classes provided
					 by the EAUW. Since the association's main objective had been achieved their
					 attention turned to providing facilities and amenities for the new women
					 students. Their primary concern was to provide a meeting place for the women
					 and a hall of residence to be named Masson in honour of one of their leading
					 champions.</p> 
				  <p>In 1894 Masson Hall Incorporated was established in order that
					 the proposed hall be eligible for grants and bequests, such as the Pfeiffer
					 Trust donation of &#x00A3;2000 and the Phoebe Blyth library gift. The leading
					 activists were Miss Houldsworth and Miss Louisa Stevenson who succeeded in
					 their aim of raising enough funds to buy a property, 31 George Square, and open
					 it as a meeting point and hall of residence 24th November 1897. The association
					 thereafter became administrative until the University took over the running of
					 the halls in 1920.</p> 
				  <p>As the education of women at University grew so did the need
					 for increased accommodation. Masson Hall expanded to accommodate more students
					 however, the waiting list for a room was long and so the Edinburgh Association
					 for the Provision of Hostels for Women Students was founded to provide adequate
					 halls of residence. The site at George Square was taken over in 1964 for
					 redevelopment; Masson Hall was relocated to South Lauder Road where it remained
					 until 1994.There is still in existence a Masson House at Pollock Halls.</p>

				<head>Administrative History</head> 
				<p>The history of student administration is complex. Today these
				  affairs are handled by the University Registry but, in earlier periods, they
				  were handled elsewhere.</p> 
				<p>Prior to 1791 each professor matriculated his own class.
				  Students often attended more than one class. In 1791 and up until 1810, the
				  students attending the literary and philosophical classes enrolled themselves
				  in one continuous list, as did also the students attending the Scots and civil
				  law classes. Medical students, previous to 1763, matriculated with each
				  professor they attended. From 1810 all medical students were annually enrolled
				  in one alphabetical list. From 1811 all the students annually enrolled
				  themselves in one continued list and describe themselves as literary, medical
				  or law students.</p> 
				<p>Previous to this date, the total number of the literary and
				  philosophical students that have matriculated cannot be accurately known, from
				  the circumstance of the greater number of them attending more than one class in
				  the same session. From about the 1820s students were also matriculated
				  according to faculty.</p> 
				<p>The matriculation of students was not so strictly enforced
				  before 1809, so numbers are probably less than students who attended the
				  College. In 1812 it was stated that every student must provide himself with a
				  matriculation ticket, for which the fee was 10 shillings. Students at the time
				  could enrol between 10am and 3pm in the Library which seems to have carried out
				  this part of the matriculation process. It also stated that the entering of a
				  name in the matriculation album was the only legal record of attendance in the
				  University. Matriculation involved a different process for medical
				  students.</p> 
				<p>As part of the process of matriculation a solemn promise of
				  obedience and good behaviour was taken called a Sponsio Academia and is
				  annually prefixed to the list of students who matriculate or enrol themselves
				  each year in the album. It appears that the Sponsio had previously been taken
				  in the Great Hall of the College, accompanied by an exhortation from the
				  principal. The Sponsio then appears to have been part of signing the
				  matriculation album prefixed to the annual lists of students from 1762. The
				  Sponsio did not involve any religious test.</p>

					 <head>Scope and Content</head> 
					 <p>This album begins with the text of the 'sponsio' or
						confession of Faith (sometimes referred to as the National Covenant) of 1580,
						to which the graduates subscribed, and which continued to be subscribed to by
						Professors and Students for many years. The entries for laureations (or
						graduations) begin in August 1587, when Robert Rollock, the first Principal
						'did laureat the first classe which had passed under his charge in the Colledge
						of Edinburgh, after every one of them had subscrybed the Covenant.' </p> 
					 <p>This first class consisted of 47 students, all of whom
						signed their names, a practice which continued well into the 18th century.
						Additions were made against the names of the early graduates, probably by later
						Professors, adding designations such as 'minister verbi' or, for example,
						'Primarius, prius Regens' against the name of Patrick Sands, who was in the
						first class of graduates, and who became Principal in 1620. The Register
						records all graduates up to 1712, and medical graduates from 1710 up to
						1809.The Register itself was active in the University until 1809, and it can be
						safely said that it played a central role in the life of the institution for
						over 200 years. </p> 
					 <p>Many of the signatures in the volume are of key figures in
						the life of the University, and include those of Robert Rollock, the first
						Principal, William Drummond of Hawthornden, the Poet and Benefactor to the
						University, Robert Leighton, and Hugh Blair.</p> 
					 <p>The album was bound, at some point, out of its proper
						chronological sequence and remained so until quite recently. </p>

				<head>Administrative History</head> 
				<p>The University Library was begun in 1580 by a donation of books
				  by Clement Littil, an Edinburgh advocate and commissary. He left his
				  theological books to Edinburgh and its Kirk and these were subsequently steered
				  into the 'Town's College' by his brother in 1584.</p> 
				<p>The library collections were subsequently augmented by gifts and
				  donations. Two major gifts, from William Drummond of Hawthornden (1585-1649) in
				  the 1620s and 1630s, and one more major bequest, from a former Keeper of the
				  Library, the Revd James Nairn (1629-1678) in 1678, helped establish the Library
				  as a working collection. It had also become customary for students to make a
				  gift of money or books at their graduation. In the mid seventeenth century,
				  students were encouraged to contribute to the Library at matriculation as well
				  as graduation.</p> 
				<p>Books were also received from other sources. In 1710, the
				  Copyright Act entitled the four Scottish Universities to receive a copy of
				  every book registered at Stationers' Hall. By the beginning of the eighteenth
				  century, the Library had around 11,000 volumes. This entitlement was
				  discontinued in 1837 and replaced by an annual payment from the Treasury.</p> 
				<p>The Library was a central source for the printed materials.
				  However 1724 saw the appearance of what might be considered the first
				  departmental library. The Professor of Natural History and his students set up
				  a 'physiological library'.</p> 
				<p>Throughout the eighteenth century, the University Library was
				  controlled by the Town Council and this was often the cause of tension between
				  the College and the Council. Principal William Robertson (1721-1793) set about
				  re-organising the Library, dividing it into a general branch and a medical
				  branch. He also raised substantial funds for the library which he administered
				  himself to ensure that the money was spent wisely. During this time, students
				  could borrow a book on depositing a sum equal to the value of the book.</p> 
				<p>Intellectual access to the expanding collection of books was
				  facilitated by the creation of catalogues. Throughout the life of the Library,
				  these have taken a number of forms. In 1637, Robert Lumsden completed the first
				  press catalogue which include details of the 2410 volumes held at that time.
				  This catalogue was maintained up to 1641. A four volume catalogue was prepared
				  by Duke Gordon in 1755 and this remained the Library's main finding aid for the
				  next 50 years.</p> 
				<p>In 1809, a new alphabetical catalogue was prepared. This was
				  followed in 1824 by a 17 volume catalogue prepared by J. Morrison, a special
				  assistant in the Library.</p> 
				<p>The steady increase in the size of the collection and the
				  increased demand placed on it by the expanding student body meant that new
				  accommodation had to be found. The Library was provided with specific
				  accommodation in 1617 and a new Library building was founded in 1642. In 1827,
				  the books were transferred to the completed Adam-Playfair building now known as
				  Old College. This building provided elegant accommodation for the storage of
				  the collections and the students. However, the increasing pressures of the
				  storage and user demand meant that new solutions to the problem had to be
				  found. Throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a number of ad
				  hoc solutions were adopted, any available space was employed for books or
				  readers.</p> 
				<p>The idea of a new library building had been considered as early
				  as 1944 and various sites were examined. In 1949, the Library Committee started
				  to look into what might be required for an entirely new building. The process
				  was slow and it wasn't until 1967 that the new Library Building at George
				  Square was opened.</p> 
				<p>Edinburgh University Library now forms part of the Information
				  Services Group.</p>

				  <head>Administrative History</head> 
				  <p>The University Library was begun in 1580 by a donation of
					 books by Clement Littil, an Edinburgh advocate and commissary. He left his
					 theological books to Edinburgh and its Kirk and these were subsequently steered
					 into the 'Town's College' by his brother in 1584.</p> 
				  <p>The library collections were subsequently augmented by gifts
					 and donations. Two major gifts, from William Drummond of Hawthornden
					 (1585-1649) in the 1620s and 1630s, and one more major bequest, from a former
					 Keeper of the Library, the Rev. James Nairn (1629-1678) in 1678, helped
					 establish the Library as a working collection. </p> 
				  <p>It had also become customary for students to make a gift of
					 money or books at their graduation. In the mid seventeenth century, students
					 were encouraged to contribute to the Library at matriculation as well as
					 graduation. Books were also received from other sources. In 1710, the Copyright
					 Act entitled the four Scottish Universities to receive a copy of every book
					 registered at Stationers' Hall. This entitlement lasted until 1837.</p> 
				  <p>The Committee of Curators was formed in 1807, initially
					 numbering twelve of those professors willing to undertake such duties and
					 rotated with four retiring annually. In 1842 the number of Curators was reduced
					 to six. Its role was to act as a regulator to the Library, including
					 sanctioning the purchase of new books. In 1847, the Principal became an
					 ex-officio Curator.</p> 
				  <p>The Book Purchase Sub-committee was established in 1895 to
					 which the Librarian had to report regularly on expediture and available funds.
					 It selected and recommended books for purchase for approval at the full Library
					 Committee.</p> 
				  <p>By the 1930s recommendation methods also came from 'suggestion
					 forms', available to Library and academic staff, or via the suggestions book
					 which was kept at the main counter of the Library.</p>

				<p>Although the Medical School can trace its origins back to the
				  barber surgeons of Edinburgh in the early part of the 16th century, the Faculty
				  of Medicine did not gain formal recognition within the University until 1726.
				  During the 18th and much of the 19th centuries, Edinburgh was regarded as the
				  leading medical centre in Europe and up to the present day can claim many
				  distinguished medical practitioners and scientists among its alumni and staff.
				  </p> 
				<p>The academic departments in the Faculty of Medicine were
				  distributed through the Medical School Buildings and the main teaching
				  hospitals in the city of Edinburgh. University reorganisation in 2002 saw the
				  Faculty of Medicine become part of the College of Medicine and Veterinary
				  Medicine.</p>

				  <p>The Science Degrees Committee was set up in 
					 <date certainty="certain" type="single" normal="1864">1864
						</date>to regulate the study of scientific subjects in the University of
					 Edinburgh. From the beginning of the University, Science subjects had been
					 studied, but had been regulated in the Faculty of Arts and later the Faculty of
					 Medicine. It was set up after a proposal by Sir Lyon Playfair in 
					 <date certainty="certain" type="single"
					 normal="1863">1863</date> that a committee be set up to consider the provision
					 of a Degree in Science. In 
					 <date certainty="certain" type="single"
					 normal="1864">1864</date> the committee made its first report. The new degrees
					 of Bachelor of Science and Doctor of Science were first offered in the Academic
					 year 
					 <date certainty="certain" type="inclusive"
					 normal="1864/1865">1864-1865 </date>in Physical and Natural Science, Mental
					 Science and Philology. The Science Degrees Committee oversaw the administration
					 of these degrees until 
					 <date certainty="certain" type="single"
					 normal="1893">1893</date> when the Faculty of Science was instituted. The
					 Committee was disbanded and the Faculty of Science took over its
					 responsibilities.</p>

				<head>Administrative History</head> 
				<p>The Royal (Dick) Veterinary College was reconstituted as an
				  integral part of the University of Edinburgh in 1951 and became a full faculty
				  in 1964. Recent restructuring in the University (2002) abolished faculties and
				  the School is now a part of the College of Medicine and Veterinary
				  Medicine.</p> 
				<p>Since 1962, the Faculty has operated on two sites, at Summerhall
				  and at the Easter Bush Veterinary Centre, near Roslin, six miles south of
				  Edinburgh. This split was rendered necessary because of the growing difficulty
				  of obtaining large animal clinical material at Summerhall. Two site operation
				  means that each of the undergraduate years can be exposed to work with farm
				  animals and horses in an appropriate rural setting. Sited within the
				  University's developing Technopole, the Easter Bush Veterinary Centre forms
				  part of one of the most comprehensive aggregations of rural and agricultural
				  research institutes in the world. </p>

				<head>Administrative History</head> 
				<p>Although not actually set up until 
				  <date certainty="certain" type="single"
				  normal="1919">1919</date>, the Institute of Animal Genetics had its origins in 
				  <date certainty="certain" type="single" normal="1911">1911</date>
				  when the Development Commissioners formulated an ambitious scheme for the
				  encouragement of agricultural education and research. A committee was set up to
				  advise them of the best means of contributing to the study of animal breeding
				  problems. Because at that time there were many well-known researchers working
				  at the University of Edinburgh, such as James Cossar Ewart ( 
				  <date certainty="certain" type="life-span"
				  normal="1851/1933">1851-1933</date>), Professor of Natural History, Francis
				  Hugh Adam Marshall, ( 
				  <date certainty="certain" type="life-span"
				  normal="1878/1949">1878-1949</date>), physiologist, and Arthur Darbishire, ( 
				  <date certainty="certain" type="life-span"
				  normal="1879/1915">1879-1915</date>), lecturer in Genetics and Animal Breeding,
				  and since it was a stated policy to encourage a close association between the
				  research institutes that were to be formed in the universities, it was evident
				  that Edinburgh would become the centre for research in Animal Breeding.</p> 
				<p>In 
				  <date certainty="certain" type="single" normal="1913">1913</date>
				  the University of Edinburgh and East of Scotland College of Agriculture Joint
				  Committee on Research in Animal Breeding was formed. The Joint Committee
				  submitted a proposal which resulted in an agreement that a scheme of work
				  monitored by a scientific director be drawn up. With the advent of the First
				  World War the plans had to be temporarily put to one side, particularly in the
				  light of the death of Arthur Dukinfield Darbishire in 
				  <date certainty="certain" type="death" normal="1915">1915</date>,
				  the chosen candidate for the post of Director. It took a further four years
				  before the project would finally get off the ground under the direction of
				  Francis Albert Eley Crew ( 
				  <date certainty="certain" type="life-span"
				  normal="1886/1973">1886-1973</date>), who held an Assistantship in the Natural
				  History Department of the University of Edinburgh. The centre that was founded
				  was known as the Department of Research in Animal Breeding, managed by the
				  Joint Committee and funded by the University, the Development Commission and
				  the Board of Agriculture for Scotland, while within the University, the
				  Department was not part of the University structure.</p> 
				<p>In 
				  <date certainty="certain" type="single" normal="1924">1924</date>
				  the centre moved out to the (then) new Chemistry Building on the King's
				  Buildings campus, and also gained 7 acres of grassland which provided an
				  opportunity for maintaining a few farm animals under direct control for
				  experimental purposes. A year later the department was expanded thanks to
				  various endowments and donations, allowing for the creation of the Buchanan
				  Chair of Animal Genetics in 
				  <date certainty="certain" type="chairdate"
				  normal="1928">1928</date>, to which Crew was appointed, also the foundation of
				  a new building on the Kings Buildings site (the present Crew building), and
				  provided additional funds for research. A further result was that the Joint
				  Committee was disbanded and the Department became an integral part of the
				  University with a new Animal Breeding Committee advising on the management of
				  the Department. In 
				  <date certainty="certain" type="single" normal="1930">1930</date>
				  the Department was renamed the Institute of Animal Genetics and transferred to
				  the newly completed Genetics Building.</p> 
				<p>Professor Crew was also successful in securing the Institute as
				  the location for the Imperial Bureau of Animal Genetics, which was established
				  in 
				  <date certainty="certain" type="single" normal="1930">1930</date>
				  to disseminate information through reviews and bibliographies, with Animal
				  Breeding Abstracts being first published in 
				  <date certainty="certain" type="publication"
				  normal="1933">1933</date>. The pre-war period concluded with the staging of the
				  7th International Congress of Genetics in Edinburgh in 
				  <date certainty="certain" type="single" normal="193909">September
					 1939</date> which was suspended by the outbreak of war. Many of the staff at
				  the Institute were immediately called up for war service and it was placed in
				  the charge of Alan William Greenwood ( 
				  <date certainty="uncertain" type="life-span"
				  normal="1897/1985">1897-c1980</date>), head of the Poultry Section.</p> 
				<p>After the war Professor Crew returned to the University of
				  Edinburgh where he took up the Chair of Public Health and Social Medicine, and
				  the directorship of the Institute of Animal Genetics was taken over by
				  Greenwood. In 
				  <date certainty="certain" type="single" normal="1945">1945</date>
				  the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) formed the National Animal Breeding and
				  Genetics Research Organisation (NABGRO), the genetics laboratory of which was
				  housed in the Institute, directed by Conrad Hal Waddington ( 
				  <date certainty="certain" type="life-span"
				  normal="1905/1975">1905-1975</date>), who was appointed to the Chair of Animal
				  Genetics one year later. Another year later, NABGRO was then renamed the Animal
				  Breeding and Genetics Research Organisation (ABGRO). Also in 
				  <date certainty="certain" type="single"
				  normal="1947">1947</date>, the University Department of Animal Genetics was
				  constituted within the Institute. </p> 
				<p>Following the retirement of Robert G White (the then Director of
				  ABRGO) in 
				  <date certainty="certain" type="single"
				  normal="1950">1950</date>, Hugh P Donald ( 
				  <date certainty="certain" type="life-span"
				  normal="1908/1989">1908-1989</date>) was appointed co-director with Waddington,
				  each in charge of one section of the Institute; Animal Breeding and Animal
				  Genetics respectively. The situation was further complicated by the fact that
				  the head of the Genetics Section was not employed by the ARC but by the
				  University of Edinburgh. However, this was rectified in 
				  <date certainty="certain" type="single" normal="1951">1951</date>
				  when Donald was appointed Director of the renamed Animal Breeding Research
				  Organisation (ABRO), while the Animal Genetics Section under Waddington became
				  a separate ARC funded group within the University Department. It was eventually
				  designated the ARC Unit of Animal Genetics in 
				  <date certainty="certain" type="single"
				  normal="1957">1957</date>. The Unit continued under Waddington until his
				  departure in 
				  <date certainty="certain" type="single" normal="1968">1968</date>
				  when the Deputy Director, Douglas Scott Falconer (from 
				  <date certainty="certain" type="appointmentdate"
				  normal="1969">1969</date> also Head of the Department of Genetics) took over as
				  Director. The Unit continued until Falconer's retirement in 
				  <date certainty="certain" type="single" normal="1980">1980</date>
				  when it was disbanded. The Genetics Building has also been renamed the Crew
				  Building. </p>

				<p>The 'Chair of Physik and Chymistry' was established in 1713,
				  with James Crawford (1682-1731) as first professor. A Chair of Chemistry at
				  Cambridge predated Edinburgh by a decade. Oxford was not to have one until the
				  19th century. Under Andrew Plummer (1697-1756) and John Innes (d1773) the couse
				  was offered as being taught 'according to the Method of the celebrated Herman
				  Boerhaave, at Leyden'. The College Physik Garden was also well utilised.
				  Amongst the students of this period was James Hutton (1726-1797) who went on to
				  be recognised as one of science's great innovators and a founder member of the
				  Royal Society of Edinburgh.</p> 
				<p>William Cullen (1710-1790) became joint professor with Plummer
				  in 1755 and then third professor the following year. He developed the teaching
				  mechanisms within the department, moving away from that of Boerhaave,
				  developing the teaching laboratory and the application of chemistry to
				  industry. His lectures were also in English rather than Latin.</p> 
				<p>Cullen's successor was Joseph Black (1728-1799). He had assisted
				  Cullen earlier in Glasgow. Black was the discoverer of 'fixed air' (carbon
				  dioxide), a correspondent of Antoine Laurent Lavoisier (1743-1794) and close
				  friend of James Watt (1736-1819). Black's research gave way to his development
				  of teaching at Edinburgh. He successfully used practical demonstrations during
				  lectures and his class sizes exceeded 200. His successor had also been his
				  student. Thomas Charles Hope (1866-1844) became fifth professor of Chemistry
				  and Chemical Pharmacy in 1795. His lecturing skills led him to become the 'most
				  popular teacher of chemistry in Britain'. Lecture attendances rose from 293 in
				  1799 to 559 in 1823. He kept his lectures up to date and was also the first to
				  expound Lavoisier's ideas in Britain.</p> 
				<p>William Gregory (1803-1858) became sixth professor in 1844
				  amidst unprecedented competition for the post. This was the first time that the
				  position was solely the Chair of Chemistry. During his term he published his
				  textbook 
				  <bibref><title render="italic">Outlines of Chemistry</title>,
					 (<imprint><date type="publication" normal="1845"
					 certainty="certain">1845</date>)</imprint></bibref>. His successor was one of
				  the previously unsuccessful candidates (Sir) Lyon Playfair (1818-1898), who
				  held the post until he was elected MP for the Universities of Edinburgh and St
				  Andrews in 1869.</p> 
				<p>Alexander Crum Brown (1838-1922) succeeded to the post, shortly
				  after the BSc and DSc degrees had been established. His major contribution to
				  chemistry was the development of the graphical illustration of chemical
				  formulae. During his term he was involved in the development of the Medical
				  School building, into which department he moved. The period also saw the
				  introduction of salaries and the appointment of lecturers. Crum Brown also
				  became part of the newly created Faculty of Science in 1893 (although the
				  chemistry chair remained within the Faculty of Medicine).</p> 
				<p>(Sir) James Walker (1863-1935), formerly private assistant to
				  Crum Brown, was his successor. He found laboratory resources stretched but the
				  outbreak of the First World War prevented any immediate resolution. The war saw
				  Walker using graduates, students and staff in production of TNT. The immediate
				  post-war period saw the transfer of chemistry to the Faculty of Science and the
				  physical move to the new King's Buildings campus. The four year BSc degree in
				  Chemistry was introduced in 1921 and a year later the degree in Technical
				  Chemistry was introduced in conjunction with Heriot-Watt College. The latter to
				  develop into the Department of Chemical Engineering by 1960.</p> 
				<p>Former Edinburgh graduate James Kendall (1889-1978) became tenth
				  professor in 1928. This was a period of diverse research work. Lecturers
				  included future Nobel Prize winner Heinrich Wieland (1877-1957) and (Sir)
				  Edmund Langley Hirst (1898-1975) joined the department, appointed to the new
				  Forbes Chair of Organic Chemistry. The department increasingly became a source
				  of advice to government and industry and also saw its medical dimension moved
				  to the Department of Biochemistry (initially the Department of Chemistry
				  Relating to Medicine).</p> 
				<p>Hirst succeeded Kendall as head of department in 1959, with Tom
				  L Cottrell (1923-1973) becoming eleventh chair. The latter was a former
				  Edinburgh graduate who had done extensive research work within the industrial
				  sector. These research skills were developed into 'a flourishing research
				  school in physical chemistry' at Edinburgh. He published extensively and he set
				  up the first British group to invesigate molecular beams.</p> 
				<p>The 1960s saw Charles Kemball (1923-:) become twelfth professor
				  and the appointments of Elizabeth Ebsworth (1933-:) to the new Crum Brown Chair
				  of Chemistry, and Neil Campbell (1903-:) to a Personal Chair of Chemistry. All
				  gained large degrees of professional recognition for their research work and
				  publications. In 1969, (Sir) John IG Cadogan (1930-:), amongst who's
				  innovations was the introduction of Evironmental Chemistry to Edinburgh, was
				  appointed to the Forbes Chair, a position he held for a decade during which
				  time the department gained a &#x00A3;92,500 award to fund a Unit for High Speed
				  Liquid Chromatography. John Knox (1927-:) was appointed to the position of
				  director of the unit and to a Personal Chair in Physical Chemistry.</p> 
				<p>Robert Donovan (1941-:), internationally acclaimed for work on
				  spectroscopy and photochemical studies, was appointed to a Personal Chair in
				  Physical Chemistry in 1979 and took over as thirteenth professor in 1986. His
				  research group secured the necessary funding to acquire for the department
				  laser equipment which met the current highest international standards.
				  Sufficient funding was also acquired to purchase a Nuclear Magetic Response
				  (NMR) spectrometer. Grants were also obtained from the Science (and
				  Engineering) Research Council for research and upgrading equipment.</p> 
				<p>In 1980 Alistair Ian Scott (1928-:) was appointed to the Forbes
				  Chair and in 1984 Robert Ramage (1934-:) was appointed to the same. Ramage's
				  interests in the field of antibiotics were reflected in developing work in
				  biological sciences. A research grant of &#x00A3;119,000 was achieved from the
				  Science and Engineering Research Council for collagen research and of
				  &#x00A3;90,000 for the Vitamin Research Group. There was also support from the
				  Wellcome Trust for work on DNA. In 1989 David WH Rankin (1945-:), already a
				  research fellow within the department, was appointed to a Personal Chair in
				  Structural Chemistry and devoloped the NMR Unit.</p>

				<p>The Godfrey Thomson Unit [Room 70] takes its names from Sir
				  Godfrey H. Thomson (1881-1955), who served as both Professor of Education at
				  the University of Edinburgh and Director of Studies at Moray House Training
				  College between 1925-1951. The Unit is best known for production of the Moray
				  House Tests, assessment tests administered to students throughout the UK during
				  the course of the 20th century. </p> 
				<p>Godfrey Thomson began his involvement in intelligence assessment
				  while Chair of Education at Armstrong College, Newcastle, when he was asked by
				  the Northumberland Authority to develop the first British group intelligence
				  tests for use in the Special Place examination. Devised by Thomson in 1921, the
				  Northumberland Mental Tests were administered to a large number of eleven year
				  old children who were candidates for free places in secondary schools, and are
				  the precursor to the Moray House Tests. In 1925 Thomson was appointed as both
				  Professor of Education at the University of Edinburgh and Director of Studies
				  at Moray House Training College, stating that he would see his university and
				  college duties merge without 'an over-nice discrimination between the two
				  halves'. Thomson continued his studies in statistics and psychometrics in
				  Edinburgh, and soon established a test construction and research unit. Staffed
				  by members of the of the University of Edinburgh Education Department, the unit
				  was located in Room 70 in the Moray House College building now known as
				  Paterson's Land. Thus, the unit came to be known as 'Room 70' and the tests
				  were called the 'Moray House Tests.' The tests primarily fall into three major
				  categories: Verbal Reasoning (M.H.T.), English (M.H.E.) and Mathematics
				  (M.H.M.). By 1948 Moray House Tests were administered to two out of three
				  British children and were used and recognised throughout the world. In 1949 one
				  and a quarter million Moray House Tests were sold, making the University the
				  largest supplier of tests in Europe. </p> 
				<p>Royalties earned from test sales were transferred into a
				  research fund - later registered as the Godfrey Thomson Research Fund-
				  established by Thomson to support continued educational research and assessment
				  in particular. Established in a formal basis in 1940 when a Deed of Trust was
				  drawn up between Thomson and the University, the Fund was later administered by
				  trustees, with the Professor of Education as Chairman and the Principal of
				  Moray House College of Education as Vice-Chairman. In addition to test
				  royalties, the fund also earned income from fees paid by county Education
				  Committees for the analysing, collating and assessing the results of Moray
				  Houses Tests administered to students. </p> 
				<p>Upon Thomson's retirement in 1951, the University and College
				  posts were once again disassociated, with John Pilley taking over Professor of
				  Education, University of Edinburgh, while Dr. W.B Inglis became the new
				  Director of Studies at Moray House. However, the University Department of
				  Education, including the 'Room 70' research unit, continued to be accommodated
				  at Moray House. In September 1952 the unit relocated to Room 76, although it
				  retained the moniker Room 70. At this time the unit employed eight staff
				  members, six of which were paid through the Thomson Research Fund. In 1965 the
				  Room 70 unit formally became Godfrey Thomson Unit for Academic Assessment
				  (University of Edinburgh). By the late 1960's the unit was lead by A.E.G.
				  Pilliner and was no longer based at Moray House, instead occupying premises at
				  Buccleuch Place, where it would remain into the 1990s. </p>

				<p>In 
				  <date certainty="certain" type="single" normal="1964">1964</date>
				  Professor Conrad Hal Waddington had made the original proposal for a Science
				  Studies unit of this kind, but it was not until 
				  <date certainty="certain" type="single" normal="1966">1966</date>
				  that it was actually founded, with the help of a generous grant from the
				  Wolfson Foundation. The aim of the Unit was to develop a programme of teaching
				  and research on social aspects of science. It is an interdisciplinary group,
				  combining expertise in history, philosophy, and sociology, mostly though not
				  exclusively within a sociology of scientific knowledge perspective. Originally,
				  the Unit was set up as a separate department based in the Science Faculty, but
				  is now located within the Department of Sociology in the Social Sciences
				  Faculty. In 
				  <date certainty="certain" type="single" normal="1987">1987</date>
				  it was designated by the University Grants Commission as one of four major UK
				  Centres of Excellence in its field. </p> 
				<p>At present the team is comprised of four members of academic
				  staff, supported by several research students. The main undergraduate teaching
				  is provided for science, engineering and medical students, and serves to
				  introduce them to the historical development of scientific knowledge and the
				  characteristics of science as a social institution.</p>
