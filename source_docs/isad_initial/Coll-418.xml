		<p>Henry Duncan Littlejohn was born in Leith in 1828. He was educated at
		  Perth Academy and the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and he studied at Edinburgh
		  University and in Paris. After graduating he served in general practice in
		  Selkirk, but he returned to Edinburgh in 1855. He started as a Lecturer in
		  Medical Jurisprudence, first at the Extra-Mural School of Medicine. He was also
		  a medical hygienist and in 1862 he was appointed as Edinburgh's Medical Officer
		  of Health, a post which he held until 1908. Littlejohn became a brilliant
		  jurist, and the Ardlamont murder trial, 1893, (in which Alfred John Monson was
		  tried for the attempted murder of Lieut. W. C. Hambrough, at Ardlamont,
		  Argyllshire) was the most famous he was involved in. Littlejohn was knighted in
		  1895. He was elected to the Chair of Medical Jurisprudence, Edinburgh
		  University, in 1897, at the age of sixty-nine, and retired in 1906. His
		  publications were numerous in the fields of legal medicine and public health,
		  and his 
		<title>Report on the sanitary condition of the City of Edinburgh</title>
		(1865) became a classic in the field of public health. Sir Henry Duncan
		Littlejohn died on 30 September 1914.</p>
