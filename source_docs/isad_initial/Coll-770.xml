		<p>John Henry Newman was born in London. He studied at Trinity College,
		  Oxford, from 1817 and in 1822 was elected a Fellow of Oriel. He was ordained in
		  1824. Newman broke with Evangelicalism in 1830, and became involved in the
		  Tractarian movement, composing a number of the 
		<title>Tracts for the times</title>. His 
		<title>Tract XC</title> provoked a storm which ended the movement and
		brought on the conversion to Catholicism of many Tractarians. In October 1845
		Newman was received into the Roman Catholic Church and shortly after he went to
		Rome for a year and a half. On his return to England in 1848 he established a
		branch of the brotherhood of St. Philip Neri at Edgbaston, Birmingham. In 1879,
		he was summoned to Rome to be appointed Cardinal by Pope Leo XIII. His other
		publications included 
		<title>The Arians of the fourth century</title> (1833), lectures on 
		<title>Anglican difficulties</title> (1850), lectures on 
		<title>Catholicism in England</title> (1851), the poem 
		<title>The dream of Gerontius</title>, and his philosophy of faith 
		<title>Grammar of assent</title> (1870). Cardinal John Henry Newman died
		in Edgbaston on 11 August 1890.</p>

		<p>The collection is composed of letters of Newman to either Jane Whyte
		  and Alexander Whyte, 1881-1885, or of Sir Frederick Whyte and C. Stephen
		  Dessain to James Bartholomew Primrose and John Alexander Lamb, 1953-1960. There
		  is also a letter from Fr. Henry Tristram to Lamb, 1953.</p>
