		<p>The modern House of Lords has its origins in 11th century Anglo-Saxon
		  witans or councils consulted by early kings and attended by religious leaders,
		  magnates and the king's own ministers - the nobility of the country. These
		  often assembled at Westminster Hall which was built in 1097-1099 as part of an
		  intended reconstruction of the Palace of Westminster. By the 13th century, King
		  Henry III (1216-1272) was meeting opposition from his nobles who were
		  discontented by his various schemes and the 1258 Provisions of Oxford imposed a
		  more permanent baronial Council which was to meet regularly. Attendance at
		  these Councils began to include representatives of counties, cities and
		  boroughs. The leader of the movement behind the new form of Council was Simon
		  de Montfort, the Earl of Leicester (d. 1265). By the 14th century, two distinct
		  houses emerged within this forerunner of parliament, namely the Commons
		  composed of shire and borough representatives, and the Lords composed of
		  religious leaders (Lords Spiritual) and magnates (Lords Temporal).</p> 
		<p>Until the Reformation in the 16th century, the Lords Spiritual made up
		  the majority of members of the House of Lords and included archbishops,
		  bishops, abbots, and priors. After the suppression of the monasteries in 1539,
		  only archbishops and bishops attended and the Lords Temporal formed the
		  majority for the first time. In the 18th century, the Act of Union 1707 between
		  Scotland and England, and the Act of Union 1800 between Great Britain and
		  Ireland, entitled Scottish and Irish peers to elect representatives from among
		  themselves to sit in the House of Lords (though elections for Irish
		  representative peers ended in 1922).</p> 
		<p>Today the Lords Spiritual include the Archbishops of Canterbury and
		  York, the Bishops of Durham, London and Winchester, and other senior Church of
		  England Bishops. Until 1958, the Lords Temporal were all either hereditary
		  peers (inheriting their titles) or Law Lords. In 1958, the Life Peerages Act
		  was passed and this gave the Queen the entitlement to give non-hereditary
		  titles (life peerages) to men and women on the advice of the Prime Minister and
		  with no limit on numbers. The Peerage Act 1963 allowed hereditary peeresses to
		  be members of the House, and entitled all Scottish peers to sit. Since the
		  House of Lords Act 1999 removing the right of most hereditary peers to sit and
		  vote in the House, only 99 peers sit by virtue of an inherited title. Of these,
		  75 were elected by their respective party groups and 17 had ceremonial offices.
		  Senior judges also sit in the House of Lords as Lords of Appeal (Law
		  Lords).</p> 
		<p>A White Paper for further reform of the House of Lords was published
		  in 2001. In February 2002, a total of 700 peers were entitled to sit there.</p>
