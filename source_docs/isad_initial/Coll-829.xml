		<p>The historian Archibald Campbell was born in 1846. He was a son of
		  George Douglas Campbell (1823-1900), 8th Duke of Argyll. The young Campbell was
		  educated at Edinburgh Academy, Eton and at Goettingen. Before entering the
		  business world he had been a Captain in the 5th Battalion Argyll and Sutherland
		  Highlanders. Latterly he was a partner in Coutts and Co. bankers at 440 Strand,
		  London. He was a JP and Deputy-Lieutenant for Argyllshire. His publications
		  include 
		<title>Records of Argyll</title> (1885), 
		<title>Notes on swords from Battlefield of Culloden</title> (1894), 
		<title>Highland dress, arms, and ornament</title> (1899), 
		<title>Armada canon</title> (1899), and 
		<title>Reveries, poems</title> (1902). Lord Archibald Campbell died on 29
		March 1913.</p>

		<p>The material is composed of: letters from Campbell to Lady Metcalfe
		  one accepting an invitation and the other relating to domestic matters. The
		  third item is rather more on behalf of Lord Campbell and mentions a cheque and
		  the need for a bill to be 'receipted'.</p>
