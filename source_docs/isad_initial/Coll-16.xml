		<p>Joseph Black was born in Bordeaux, France, on 16 April 1728. His
		  father, of Scottish descent and a native of Belfast, was involved in the wine
		  business in France. Black was educated in Belfast and then studied medicine and
		  natural sciences at Glasgow University where his chemistry instructor was
		  William Cullen (1710-1790). In 1751 Black transferred his medical studies to
		  Edinburgh. In 1756 he succeeded Cullen as Lecturer in Chemistry at Glasgow
		  University and was also appointed Professor of Anatomy, later on exchanging to
		  the Chair of Medicine. Black also practiced as a physician. Through his
		  investigation of the heating of magnesium carbonate, he anticipated the
		  findings of Antoine Laurent Lavoisier (1743-1794), and indeed of modern
		  chemistry, by indicating the existence of the gas carbon dioxide as distinct
		  from common air. An account of his studies was published in 
		<title>Experiments upon magnesia alba, quicklime, and some other alcaline
		  substances </title> (1756). Black's work at Glasgow led to the doctrine of
		latent heat. He verified the hypothesis in 1761, thereafter teaching the
		doctrine and doubtless influencing his friend James Watt (1736-1819) in the
		construction of the condensing steam engine. Black also founded the theory of
		specific heats. In 1766 until 1799, Black was Professor of Chemistry at
		Edinburgh University. Joseph Black died in Edinburgh on 10 November 1799. His
		lecture notes, supplemented by those of his pupils, were written and published
		posthumously by John Robison as 
		<title>Lectures on the elements of chemistry, delivered in the University
		  of Edinburgh </title> (1803). </p>

		<p>The Joseph Black Manuscript collection consists of volumes of
		  correspondence between himself and a variety of persons (including James Watt,
		  Prince Paul Dashkov, Johann Albrecht Euler), and on a variety of subjects:
		  linen bleaching, use of lime water, assays of ores, civic water supply,
		  mineralogical specimens, absorption of heat etc. There are family letters too,
		  between Black and his father and his brothers Samuel, George and Thomas, again
		  on a variety of subjects: legal and money matters, health matters, trade with
		  America, French flax, naval telegraphy, French prisoners in Edinburgh Castle
		  etc. There are also manuscript copies of Black's Chemistry Lectures. </p>
