		<p>In 1819 the Presidents of the Scots Law Society were Messrs. James
		  Robertson, Robert Ellis, and David Houston. The Secretary was James Knox. Into
		  the mid-nineteenth century, William Lindsay of Bernard Street, Leith, and a
		  little later on A. Thomson Jnr., held the post of Secretary. The Scots Law
		  Society was also sometimes referred to as the Scots Law Society College. The
		  Society published 
		<title>Law cases and speculative questions for the discussion of the
		  Scots Law Society</title>. This was printed by Oliver and Boyd, High Street,
		Edinburgh. Some of the issues speculated over in March 1827 were: Would it be
		expedient to introduce the practice of the Coroner's Inquests to this country?
		Is their a standard of Taste? Is Duelling in any circumstances justifiable? Can
		Machinery ever be so extensively employed as to become prejudicial to a
		country? and Is there a moral sense?</p>
