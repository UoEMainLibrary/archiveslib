		<p>John Hunter was born on 13 February 1728 in Long Calderwood in the
		  area of East Kilbride. As the youngest of ten children his early education was
		  somewhat neglected but when he was seventeen he began to acquire cabinet-making
		  skills from his brother-in-law in Glasgow. At the age of twenty he went to
		  London, working with his anatomist brother William Hunter (1718-1783) in his
		  dissecting-room. Taking to the work quite well, he attended Chelsea Hospital
		  and St. Bartholomew's between 1749 and 1751, and after appointment in 1753 as a
		  'master of anatomy' to the Surgeons' Corporation he entered St. George's
		  Hospital in 1754 as a surgeon's pupil. Hunter then studied at St. Mary's Hall,
		  Oxford, between 1755 and 1756. In the late-1750s, Hunter was assisting his
		  brother and at this time traced the descent of the testes in the foetus, made
		  discoveries as to the nature of placental circulation, and investigated the
		  nasal and olfactory nerves. In 1760, poor health encouraged him to accept a
		  place as surgeon on an expedition to Belle Isle, Newfoundland, and while there
		  he occupied himself studying coagulation of blood. In 1762 he served with the
		  army in Portugal and on his return in 1763 he opened a surgical practice in
		  London and gave private classes in anatomy and operative surgery. In 1766
		  Hunter was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, London, and in
		  1767 he became a member of the Surgeons' Corporation. In 1768 he was appointed
		  Surgeon at St. George's Hospital and his own practice expanded as a result, so
		  that he was able to take house-pupils one of whom was the young Edward Jenner
		  (1749-1823). In 1776 Hunter was appointed Surgeon Extraordinary to King George
		  III. By 1788 he headed the surgical profession. Hunter's publications and
		  papers include 
		<title>Treatise on the human teeth</title> (1771), 
		<title>On the digestion of the stomach after death</title> (1772), 
		<title>Proposals for the recovery of people apparently drowned</title>
		(1776), 
		<title>Treatise on the venereal disease</title> (1786), and posthumously 
		<title>A treatise on the blood, inflammation, and gunshot wounds</title>
		(1794). John Hunter died on 16 October 1793. </p>
