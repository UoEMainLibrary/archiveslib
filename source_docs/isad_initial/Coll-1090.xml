		<head>Administrative/Biographical History</head> 
		<p>Marie Laurencin was born in Paris on 31 October 1883. She attended the
		  Lycee Lamartine in the city before studying porcelain painting at the Sevres
		  factory. Later on she entered the Academie Humbert. In 1907 she exhibited at
		  the Clovis Sagot gallery in Montmartre, and there she was introduced to
		  Guillaume Apollinaire by Pablo Picasso and she became romatically involved with
		  Apollinaire until 1913. In 1908, Laurencin achieved her first sale when
		  Gertrude Stein purchased 
		<title>Group of artists</title>. This group portrait of Laurencin,
		Apollinaire, and Picasso and his mistress became the theme of a larger version
		in 1909 entitled 
		<title>Apollinaire and his friends</title>. In 1911 she exhibited in the
		Salon des Independants, and she began illustrating books. The ending of her
		relationship with Apollinaire in 1913 also saw the end of her Cubist-inspired
		period.</p> 
		<p>In 1913, Laurencin established a contract with the art dealer Paul
		  Rosenberg which would last until 1940, and in 1914 she married the German
		  Baron, Otto von Waetjen. On the outbreak of war however they fled to Spain and
		  spent time in Madrid and Barcelona, and then also to Germany. In 1921 she
		  returned to Paris and in the same year she divorced von Waetjen. The
		  early-1920s saw Laurencin designing sets and costumes most notably for the
		  Ballets Russes - 
		<title>Les Biches</title> - as well as painting society portraits
		including that of Coco Chanel. In the 1930s she was teaching at the art
		academy, Villa Malakoff. In 1942 she published 
		<title>Le Carnet des nuits</title>. In 1944, her apartment on Rue
		Savorgnan de Brazza was requisitioned by the Germans and she did not get it
		back until 1953.</p> 
		<p>Marie Laurencin died in Paris on 8 June 1956 and she was buried in the
		  cemetary Pere Lachaise.</p>
