		<p>William Empson, born in 1791, was educated at Winchester and then
		  studied at Trinity College, Cambridge. He began to contribute to the 
		<title>Edinburgh review</title> in 1832 and from then until 1849 he wrote
		more than 60 articles on law, politics, and literary topics. In 1843 he wrote
		an article on Bentham which was contradicted by J. S. Mill in 1844. Empson was
		Professor of General Polity Upon the Laws of England at the East India College,
		Haileybury, Hertfordshire (this was the administrative training college of the
		East India Company which closed in 1858) from 1824 to 1852. He succeeded to the
		editorship of the 
		<title>Edinburgh review</title> in 1847. William Empson died at
		Haileybury on 10 December 1852.</p>

	 <scopecontent>

		  refers to a letter to Haileybury only just being received and referring to 'the
		  sudden calamity' which has brought him to Edinburgh; a letter addressed from
		  Torquay; and, a letter referring to Marianne's sister, Louisa. </p>
