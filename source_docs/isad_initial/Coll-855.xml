		<p>Thomas John Hovell-Thurlow-Cumming-Bruce was born on 5 December 1838.
		  He entered the Diplomatic Service in 1858 and served at the British Embassies
		  in Stockholm and Paris. He participated in the Earl of Elgin's mission to
		  China, 1860-1861, and was present at the capture of the Taku Forts and of
		  Peking (Beijing). He was Private Secretary to the Viceroy of India (the Earl of
		  Elgin), 1862-1863, then 3rd Secretary in Vienna, 1864, before becoming Private
		  Secretary to the Minister in Washington, 1865-1866. He was then 2nd Secretary
		  at The Hague. He succeeded to the Barony of Thurlow in 1874. Thurlow had
		  married Lady Elma Bruce, daughter of the 8th Earl of Elgin and Kincardine.
		  Thomas John Hovell-Thurlow-Cumming-Bruce, 5th Baron Thurlow, died in 1916.</p>

		<p>The collection is composed of: letter accepting invitation; letter
		  from Thurlow at Chesham Place, London SW, to G. J. Brackenridge, recommending
		  Captain Caroick as 'a thorough gentleman and very agreeable companion also
		  highly intelligent and active in mind and body', the letter appears to have
		  become exhibit 'F' in a case (Duke v. West) before the High Court of Justice,
		  Chancery Division, 1873; and, letter from Egerton Crescent, London SW, to
		  Taynmouth Shore, in which Thurlow supposes that 'the investment is all right as
		  Coutts has probably selected it' </p>
