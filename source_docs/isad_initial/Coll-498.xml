		<p>The astronomer Charles Piazzi Smyth was born in Naples on 3 January
		  1819. He was educated in Bedford and in 1835 became an Assistant at the Royal
		  Observatory, Cape of Good Hope, South Africa. There he observed Halley's Comet
		  in 1836 and co-operated with Sir Thomas Maclear (1794-1879) in the
		  re-measurement and extension of Lacaille's arc. Smyth was Astronomer-Royal for
		  Scotland between 1845 and 1888. In 1852 he organised time-signalling by the
		  dropping of a ball on the Nelson Monument on Calton Hill in Edinburgh, improved
		  in 1861 to a time-gun fired from Edinburgh Castle. It involved a signal being
		  sent along a 4,000-foot steel cable - laid by sailors from Leith in just two
		  days - to the gun at Edinburgh Castle. (Today, simultaneous with the firing of
		  the gun, a signal ball still drops from the mast atop the Nelson Monument). In
		  1851, Smyth was in Sweden to witness a total eclipse of the sun, and 1856 he
		  was on Tenerife experimenting with a telescope. In 1857 he was elected as a
		  Fellow of the Royal Society. A visit to Russia - visiting observatories -
		  followed in 1859, and in the 1860s he visited Egypt and surveyed the Pyramids.
		  Other activities included: work in spectroscopy; the study of telluric
		  absorption; the construction of a map of the solar spectrum; work with
		  Professor Alexander Herschel on the harmonic character of the carbonic-oxide
		  spectrum; the measuring of the 'citron-ray' of the aurora; gathering
		  meteorological data; the construction of a large solar chart; and, the study of
		  cloud forms using photography. Charles Piazzi Smyth died on 21 February
		  1900.</p>
