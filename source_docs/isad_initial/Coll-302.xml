		<p>Thomas Bever was born in Mortimer, Berkshire, in 1725. He was educated
		  at Oriel College, Oxford, and graduated with a B.A. in 1748. He then became a
		  Fellow of All Souls College and graduated as Bachelor of Law in 1753 and Doctor
		  of Law in 1758. Bever was then admitted to Doctors' Commons in November 1758
		  and was later promoted Judge of the Cinque Ports and Chancellor of Lincoln and
		  Bangor (Doctors' Commons, located at Paternoster Row, London, until 1858, was
		  similar to the Inns of Court where English common law, rather than civil law,
		  was taught. Members of the Doctors' Commons were those who held degrees either
		  of doctor of civil law at Oxford or doctor of law at Cambridge and who had been
		  admitted as advocates).</p> 
		<p>In 1766, Bever published 
		<title>A discourse on the study of jurisprudence, and on the civil law,
		  being an introduction to a course of lectures</title>, and then 
		<title>The history of the legal polity of the Roman state; and of the
		  rise, progress, and extent of the Roman laws</title> (1781). Thomas Bever died
		in London on 8 November 1791.</p>
