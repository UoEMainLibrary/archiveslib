		<p>William Henry Walsh was born in Leeds on 10 December 1913. He was
		  educated at Bradford and Leeds Grammar Schools, and studied at Merton College,
		  Oxford. In 1936 he won a Junior Research Fellowship at Merton, focussing on
		  philosophy. Between 1940 and 1941 Walsh served with the Royal Corps of Signals
		  and then was employed by the Foreign Office, 1941-1945. He returned to Merton
		  in 1946 and specialised in Kant, but then went to Dundee (then part of St.
		  Andrews University) as a Lecturer in Philosophy, 1946-1947. He returned to
		  Merton as a Fellow and Tutor of the College, and Lecturer in the University of
		  Oxford, 1947-1960. In 1960, Walsh was appointed Professor of Logic and
		  Metaphysics at Edinburgh University. He retired from Edinburgh in 1979 and
		  returned to Merton as Fellow Emeritus of the College. His publications include 
		<title>Reason and experience</title> (1947), 
		<title>An introduction to philosophy of history</title> (1951), and 
		<title>Metaphysics</title> (1963). Professor William Henry Walsh died 7
		April 1986.</p>
