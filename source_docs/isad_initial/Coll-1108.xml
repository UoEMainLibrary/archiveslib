		<head>Administrative/Biographical History</head> 
		<p>Angus McIntosh was born to Scottish parents near Sunderland, County
		  Durham, on 10 January 1914. He was educated at Ryhope Grammar School, then at
		  Oriel College Oxford where in 1934 he graduated with first class honours in
		  English language and literature. Between 1936 and 1938 he was at Harvard and on
		  his return to Britain he became a Lecturer at the Department of English,
		  University College Swansea.</p> 
		<p>During the Second World War, McIntosh initially served with the Tank
		  Corps then as a Major in Military Intelligence during which time he was posted
		  to Bletchley where he participated in the decrypting of German military
		  communication Enigma codes.</p> 
		<p>After the war he took up a lectureship at Christ Church Oxford and
		  then in 1948 he was appointed first Forbes Professor of English Language and
		  General Linguistics at Edinburgh University. At Edinburgh, he was the prime
		  mover in the founding of the School of Epistemics - now Informatics - and the
		  School of Scottish Studies, of the then separate Departments of Linguistics and
		  Applied Linguistics. He was also behind two major dictionary projects and of
		  the Linguistic Survey of Scotland.</p> 
		<p>While looking at returns from the questionnaire for the Linguistic
		  Survey of Scotland, McIntosh realised the possibility of applying the
		  methodology of modern dialect surveys to the investigation of past stages of
		  the language. Middle English in its written forms exhibited high degrees of
		  linguistic variation, known broadly to correlate with England's geographical
		  regions. Experimenting with the Linguistic Survey data, he attempted to
		  localise material from informants purely on the evidence of their written
		  linguistic forms. The method which was devised - in what later became the
		  Middle English Dialect Project - became known as the Fit Technique, and this
		  was essentially an application of the principles of set theory to geographical
		  distributions. It was to revolutionise dialect research in historical
		  linguistics. 
		<title>A Linguistic Atlas of Late Mediaeval English</title>, or LALME,
		was published in 1986, 34 years after its inception, and enthusiastically
		received in the scholarly community. LALME led the advent of variationist
		methodology in the study of the linguistic history.</p> 
		<p>McIntosh did pioneering work for the Linguistic Survey of Scotland and
		  this resulted in the publication in 1952 of his 
		<title>Introduction to a Survey of Scottish Dialects</title>. In the same
		year he set up the Joint Council for the Scottish Dictionaries. He was also a
		tireless supporter of both the 
		<title>Scottish National Dictionary</title> and the 
		<title>Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue</title> or DOST.</p> 
		<p>From 1977 to 1989, he was president of the Scottish Text Society - and
		  later honorary president - and for many years he was a member of the Early
		  English Text Society's council. He was a member of the Finnish Academy of
		  Science and Letters, and he was a fellow of the British Academy and of the
		  Royal Society of Edinburgh.</p> 
		<p>Professor Angus McIntosh died on 26 October 2005, aged 91. That same
		  year, the Departments of English Language and of Linguistics at Edinburgh
		  University, both founded by McIntosh, merged.</p>
