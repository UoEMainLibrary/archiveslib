		<p>The Coronation of the British monarch King Edward VII and Queen
		  Alexandra took place in Westminster Abbey (the Abbey Church of St. Peter),
		  London, on Thursday 26 June 1902. He was the first British monarch of the House
		  of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Edward's mother Queen Victoria had died eighteen months
		  earlier at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, on 22 January 1901. Edward, or
		  Albert Edward, or Bertie, was born at Buckingham Palace, London, on 9 November
		  1841. His wife, Queen Alexandra was a Princess of Denmark, elder daughter of
		  King Christian IX of Denmark. They were married at St. George's Chapel, Windsor
		  on 10 March 1863.</p> 
		<p>Before the death of his mother and his own accession to the throne,
		  Edward held the title of Prince of Wales. No-one since Edward has been heir
		  apparent to the throne for a longer period. During his reign, now called the
		  Edwardian period, the office of the Prime Minister saw its first official
		  recognition. Edward VII was the first British monarch to visit Russia. This
		  happened in 1908. He had also assisted in modernising the British Home Fleet.
		  His interest in seafaring and the Navy earned him the name of 'Sailor
		  King'.</p> 
		<p>Edward VII reigned from 22 January 1901 until his death on 6 May
		  1910.</p>
