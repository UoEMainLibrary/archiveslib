		<p>Alexander Gerard was born at the manse of Chapel of Garioch,
		  Aberdeenshire, on 22 February 1728. He studied at Marischal College (now
		  Aberdeen University), and became licensed as a preacher of the Church of
		  Scotland in 1748. In 1750 he became a Professor of Philosophy at Marischal
		  College, and in 1755 he published his ideas for a re-arrangement of university
		  studies. Gerard was appointed Professor of Divinity at Marischal College in
		  1760, and at the same time Minister of Greyfriars, Aberdeen. He resigned these
		  posts on his appointment as Professor of Divinity at King's College (also
		  Aberdeen University) in 1771. He was Moderator of the General Assembly of the
		  Church of Scotland in 1764. His publications include 
		<title>An essay on genius</title> (1774), 
		<title>Liberty a cloak of maliciousness, both in the American rebellion
		  and in the manners of the times</title> (1778), and 
		<title>The corruption of Christianity</title> (1792). Professor Alexander
		Gerard died on 22 February 1795.</p>
