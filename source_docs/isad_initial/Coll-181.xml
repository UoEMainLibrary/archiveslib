		<p>Born in 1538, Thomas Craig was educated at St. Leonard's College, St.
		  Andrews, studying Latin, logic, rhetoric, ethics, and physics. In 1555 he went
		  to Paris to study civil and canon law. In 1561, he returned to Scotland to
		  complete his education. In 1563, Craig became an Advocate, and in 1564 he was
		  appointed Justice-Depute. One of the duties of this office was to preside over
		  criminal cases, and in this capacity, in April 1566, he held the courts which
		  sentenced Thomas Scott and Henry Yaire to death for their subordinate parts in
		  the murder of David Rizzio and in the treasonable seizure of Mary Stuart, Queen
		  of Scots. In 1568, he again presided over the court which sentenced Stephen
		  Dalgleish, Hay and Powrie for their parts in the murder of Henry, Lord Darnley.
		  In 1573, Craig was appointed Sheriff-Depute of Edinburgh, and by 1592 he was
		  acting as Counsel and Advocate for King James VI. His publications and
		  treatises include 
		<title>Jus Feudale</title> (1603), 
		<title>Treatise on the right of James VI to the succession to the English
		  crown</title>, 
		<title>Treatise on the union</title> (1603-1605), and 
		<title>De Hominio</title> (1605). His verse includes 
		<title>Paraeneticon of James VI leaving Scotland</title>, the 
		<title>Propempticon to Prince Henry</title>, and the 
		<title>Stefanoforia on the coronation</title> which were published in
		1603. In 1603, Craig travelled to London with King James VI and was present at
		his coronation as James I of England. In 1604, he was knighted. Sir Thomas
		Craig died on 26 February 1608.</p>
