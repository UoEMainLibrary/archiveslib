		<p>The Scottish sculptor and draughtsman William Calder Marshall was born
		  in Edinburgh on 18 March 1813. He was educated the city's Royal High School and
		  he studied at Edinburgh University. He decided to be a sculptor and studied
		  under Chantrey and Baily in Rome and he also joined the Royal Academy School.
		  He worked in Edinburgh but moved to London in 1839. In 1857 he won first prize
		  for his design for a national monument to the Duke of Wellington but this was
		  then entrusted to Alfred Stevens. He was honoured by the French government for
		  services in connection with the Paris International Exhibition in 1878. His
		  work included a bronze statue of 
		<title>Sir Robert Peel</title> (1853) commissioned for Manchester, a
		marble statue for Capetown, 
		<title>Sir George Grey</title> (1862), 
		<title>The prodigal son</title> (1881), and the set 
		<title>Agriculture</title> on the Albert Memorial. His work is also
		represented in the Palace of Westminister, Westminster Abbey, Kensington
		Gardens, Arbroath, Bolton, Coventry, and Leicester Square. William Calder
		Marshall died in London on 16 June 1894.</p>
