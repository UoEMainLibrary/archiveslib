		<p>Patrick Heron Watson was born in 1832. He became Consulting Surgeon at
		  the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh, at Leith Hospital, and at Chalmers' Hospital.
		  Watson was Attache to the Special Embassy of the Earl of Roslin on the occasion
		  of the marriage of Alfonso XII of Spain to Princess Mercedes in January 1878.
		  He became Professor of Surgery at Edinburgh University, and he was
		  Surgeon-in-Ordinary to Queen Victoria in Scotland. Watson had also been
		  Honorary Surgeon to King Edward VII in Scotland. He resided in Charlotte
		  Square, Edinburgh. Sir Patrick Heron Watson died on 21 December 1907.</p> 
	 </bioghist> 
	 <scopecontent> 
		<p>The material is composed of letters written by Watson from his home in
		  Charlotte Square, Edinburgh. One is to Mr. Burn Murdoch for his 'charming and
		  valuable gift' of 'a very beautiful woodland scene', and the other is to 'Dear
		  Balfour' requesting that he 'kindly come tomorrow morning at 9 am and lend a
		  hand at a breast case'. This latter letter asks 'Balfour' to 'forgive the
		  address' (form of address at letter-heading) because his 'memory for Christian
		  and other names' is not good.</p>
