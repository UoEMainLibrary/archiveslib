		<head>Administrative/Biographical History</head> 
		<p>The poet, Tom Scott, was born in Glasgow on 6 June 1918. He was the
		  son of a Clydeside boilermaker. In the Depression years of the 1930s, the
		  family moved from Glasgow to St. Andrews where an uncle of Tom had a
		  stonemason's business. After a brief apprenticeship to a butcher, Tom became an
		  apprentice stonemason. His poetic spirit first manifested itself in his singing
		  voice (described variously as tenor, or bass). During the Second World War,
		  although a pacifist, he contributed to the war effort - believing that fascism
		  had to be fought against - through his service in the Pay Corps. It was at this
		  time he began to write poetry. </p> 
		<p>Scott's earlier work was in English, and after the war, settling in
		  London, his circle included Kathleen Raine, and Dylan Thomas. Visits to Europe
		  encouraged his Scots poetic voice and he translated the 15th century work of
		  the French poet Villon into Scots. Other work included 
		<title>Sea dirge</title>, 
		<title>The ship</title>, 
		<title>The tree</title>, 
		<title>The dity business</title>, and 
		<title>Brand the builder</title>. In 1966 he completed a Ph.D on the work
		of William Dunbar which appeared as a book, and he edited 
		<title>The Penguin book of Scottish verse</title> (1970). In 1963, Scott
		had married Heather Fretwell and they wrote children's books. Their home was in
		the Portobello district of Edinburgh.</p> 
		<p>In the 1980s, he contracted myeloma, a rare form of leukaemia, but he
		  survived this. Tom Scott died in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on 7 August
		  1995.</p>
