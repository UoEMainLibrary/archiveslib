		<p>The painter William Mainwaring Palin was born in Hanley, Staffordshire
		  in 1862. He was the son of engraver William Palin. The younger Palin was
		  educated at Cobridge Collegiate, Stoke-on-Trent, before undertaking an
		  apprenticeship with Josiah Wedgwood and Sons, Etruria, Staffordshire. At the
		  age of eighteen he obtained a National Art Training Scholarship at the Royal
		  College of Art. In the early-1880s he was in Italy and in Paris where in the
		  latter he worked under Lefebvre and Boulanger. Between 1893 and 1897, Palin was
		  involved in the decoration of the McEwan Hall, Edinburgh, and had been
		  recommended to the Building Committee for the project by the Science and Art
		  Department, South Kensington.</p> 
		<p>The McEwan Hall is situated in Bristo Square, adjacent to Edinburgh
		  University's Medical School. It was built by Sir Robert Rowand Anderson
		  (1834-1921) between 1888 and 1897 in Italian Renaissance style. The D-plan
		  Hall, like a 'magnificent petrified blancmange with a shallow ribbed dome and
		  lantern', was originally planned as part of the University's new Medical School
		  - which was completed some 10 years earlier - but the government at the time
		  refused to fund a graduation hall which they considered frivolous. Instead, the
		  University turned to William McEwan, the brewer, who contributed one-hundred
		  and fifteen thousand pounds to fund the construction of the ostentatious
		  building. The Hall is regularly used for graduations, concerts, meetings and
		  examinations.</p> 
		<p>Palin's painted decoration of the interior of the McEwan Hall is
		  considered 'opulent'. On the dome there are figures of the Arts and Sciences.
		  Over the proscenium arch to the apse there is a huge allegorical scheme on the
		  theme of 
		<title>Temple of fame</title> with enthroned goddesses of Science, Art
		and Literature. On the right of the arch is Minerva receiving the McEwan Hall,
		and on the left Fame crowning Success. There are also figures of Perseverance,
		Intelligence, Imagination and Experience.</p> 
		<p>Palin's other principle works include the decoration of St. Clements
		  Church, Bradford, Yorkshire, in 1900, and his paintings submitted to the Royal
		  Academy, 
		<title>Orphans</title> (1892), 
		<title>The artist's mother</title> (1898), 
		<title>The light that never fails</title> (1901), 
		<title>A summer afternoon</title> (1904), 
		<title>Morning sunshine, Caudebec-en-Caux</title> (1910), and 
		<title>Chums</title> (1915). William Mainwaring Palin died on 23 July
		1947.</p>
