		<p>A Shakespeare commemorative service was held in Southwark Cathedral on
		  23 April 1909. This appeared to occur on (or rather the day before) the 345th
		  anniversary of Shakespeare's birth, and had been organised by Dr. Ralph
		  Winnington Leftwich.</p> 
		<p>In 1912 the polymath and homeopath Ralph Winnington Leftwich M.D.
		  (1849-1919) had written a pamphlet entitled 
		<title>Bacon is not Shakespeare</title> refuting claims years made by Sir
		Edward Durning-Lawrence in 
		<title>Bacon is Shakespeare</title>. Leftwich had also published 
		<title>An index of symptoms as an aid to diagnosis</title> (1888 in
		India), 
		<title>The international alphabet</title> (1898), 
		<title>An index of symptoms as a clew to diagnosis</title> (1904), 
		<title>Aids to rational therapeutics: with US pharmacopoeia</title>
		(1918), and 
		<title>The evidence of disease in Shakespeare's handwriting</title>
		(1918).</p> 
	 </bioghist> 
	 <scopecontent> 
		<p>The collection consists of letters relating to the Shakespeare
		  Commemorative Service in Southwark Cathedral, 1909, and includes too a 
		<title>Shakespeare commemorative hymn</title> by Canon H. D. Rawnsley.
		The correspondence is mostly in the form of replies to Leftwich for his
		invitations to attend the service.</p>
