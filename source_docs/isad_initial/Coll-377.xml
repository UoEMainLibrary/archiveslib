		<p>David Pollock was born in London on 2 September 1780. He was educated
		  at St. Paul's School and then he studied at Edinburgh University, though he did
		  not graduate. On 28 January 1803 he was called to the Bar at the Middle Temple.
		  He practiced on the home circuit, at the Kent sessions, and in the debtors'
		  court. Pollock was appointed Kings Council in 1833, became Recorder of
		  Maidstone in 1838, and Commissioner of the Insolvent Debtors' Court in 1842. He
		  was knighted on 2 September 1846 when he became Chief Justice of the Supreme
		  Court, Bombay. He was sworn in November 1846. Sir David Pollock died on 22 May
		  1847. His remains were interred in Bombay Cathedral.</p>
