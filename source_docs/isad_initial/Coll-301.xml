		<p>Anatomist, neurologist, and anthropologist Richard James Arthur Berry
		  was born in Upholland, Lancashire, on 30 May 1867. He was educated privately in
		  Southport, and prior to attending Edinburgh University from 1886 he was
		  apprenticed to a firm of shipbrokers in Liverpool. At University he followed
		  the medical course and graduated in 1891 with M.B. and Ch.M. He also studied in
		  Dublin, London, and Berlin. Berry then became House Surgeon to Thomas
		  Annandale, Professor of Clinical Surgery (1838-1907) at the Royal Infirmary in
		  Edinburgh. In 1894, his thesis on the vermiform appendix for the degree of M.D.
		  won him the Gunning Victoria Prize in Surgery, and in 1895 he became a Fellow
		  of the Royal College of Surgeons. In 1896, Berry was lecturing on anatomy at
		  Edinburgh University, and in 1897 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of
		  Edinburgh. In 1905, he became Professor of Anatomy at the University of
		  Melbourne, Australia. There, Berry was to revolutionise the teaching of anatomy
		  and his 
		<title>Practical anatomy</title> (1914) remained the text for students in
		Melbourne until the late-1930s. Once he had re-organised his department, he
		turned his attention to the study of Australian and Tasmanian Aboriginals and
		the metrical and non-metrical features of their skulls, and also to the study
		of mental deficiency in children. In 1929, however, Berry resigned his post and
		took up the position of Director of Medical Services at the Stoke Park Colony
		at Stapleton, Bristol, in England, and Chair of the Burden Mental Research
		Trust. Until 1940, and his retirement, he carried out extensive research into
		mental deficiency. His other publications include: 
		<title>A clinical atlas of sectional and topographical anatomy</title>
		(1911), 
		<title>A cerebral atlas of normal and defective brains</title> (1938),
		and 
		<title>Your brain and its story</title> (1939). Professor Richard James
		Arthur Berry died in Clifton, Bristol, on 30 September 1962.</p>
