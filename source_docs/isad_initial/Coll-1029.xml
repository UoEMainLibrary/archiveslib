		<p>Alexander Monro, secundus, younger son of Alexander Monro, primus
		  (1697-1767), was born in Edinburgh on 20 May 1733. He was educated at Mr.
		  Mundell's School in the city, and in 1752 he entered Edinburgh University to
		  pursue medical studies. From 1753, he occasionally lectured for his father who
		  was Professor of Anatomy and Surgery, and in July 1755 he became Joint
		  Professor with his father. In October 1755 he took the degree of Doctor of
		  Medicine, the subject of his dissertation being 
		<title>De Testibus et Semine in variis Animalibus </title>. After
		graduating he went to London to attend William Hunter's lectures, then visited
		Paris, Leyden, and Berlin. In 1758 he succeeded his father as Professor of
		Anatomy at Edinburgh University and the following year he was elected Fellow of
		the Royal College of Physicians. He became President of that body in 1779. His
		works included 
		<title>Observations on the structure and functions of the nervous system
		  </title> (1783), 
		<title>Structure and physiology of fishes explained and compared with
		  those of man and other animals </title> (1785), 
		<title>Bursae Mucosae </title> (1788), and 
		<title>The brain, the eye, and the ear </title> (1797). Between 1798 to
		1808, Monro shared the Professorship with his son, Alexander Monro, tertius
		(1773-1859). Monro died on his estate at Craiglockhart, Edinburgh, on 2 October
		1817. </p>
