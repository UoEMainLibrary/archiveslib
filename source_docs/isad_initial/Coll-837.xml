		<p>The diplomat David Montagu Erskine was born in 1776. He was the son of
		  Thomas Erskine (1750-1823), 1st Baron Erskine. He was educated at Westminster
		  School and then studied at Christ Church, Oxford. He was called to the Bar at
		  Lincoln's Inn in 1802. In 1806 however he was elected MP for Portsmouth and he
		  became Lord Chancellor. The same year he was appointed Minister Plenipotentiary
		  to the USA. He returned to Britain in 1809, and then in 1824 was appointed
		  Minister Plenipoteniary in Stuttgart, Germany and then to a post in Munich.
		  Erskine married three times: firstly in 1799 to Frances (died 1843), daughter
		  of General John Cadwalader, of Philadelphia, USA, one of the leaders of the
		  American Revolution; secondly in 1843 to Ann Bond (died 1851), daughter of John
		  Travis; and, thirdly in 1852, to Anna Calderwood. David Montagu Erskine, 2nd
		  Baron Erskine, died on 19 March 1855. The 3rd Baron Erskine and 4th Baron
		  Erskine were his sons Thomas Americus (1802-1877) and John Cadwallader (d.
		  1882) through his first marriage.</p>
