		<p>The mathematician James Gregory was born at the Manse of Drumoak,
		  Aberdeenshire, in November 1638. He was educated in Aberdeen and then studied
		  at Marischal College in the city. His scientific talent was encouraged by his
		  inventor brother, David Gregory (1627-1720) and at the age of twenty-four he
		  published 
		<title>Optica promota</title> (1663) which was a description of a
		reflecting telescope which he had invented in 1661. Between 1664 and 1667,
		Gregory studied mathematics in Padua, Italy, and while there he published 
		<title>Vera circuli et hyperbolae quadratura</title> (1667) in which he
		showed how to find the areas of the circle, ellipse, and hyperbola. After his
		return to Britain, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1668.
		The same year he published his 
		<title>Exercitationes geometricae</title>. Also in 1668 he was appointed
		Professor of Mathematics at St. Andrews University. In 1672-73 he communicated
		with Isaac Newton (1642-1727) on the merits or otherwise of their own
		telescopes. Towards the end of his life he was also absorbed with the theory of
		equations. In July 1674 he was elected as the first exclusively mathematical
		professor at Edinburgh University, and earlier that year the first Gregorian
		telescope - the type of instrument that would be used universally throughout
		the eighteenth century - was presented to the Royal Society in February 1674.
		Professor James Gregory, the Elder, died in October 1675.</p>

		<p>Important finding aids generally are: the alphabetical Index to
		  Manuscripts held at Edinburgh University Library, Special Collections and
		  Archives, consisting of typed slips in sheaf binders and to which additions
		  were made until 1987; and the Index to Accessions Since 1987. </p> 
	 </otherfindaid> 
	 <relatedmaterial> 
		<p>The local Indexes show references to Gregory related material in the
		  Laing Collection (check the Indexes for more details): document signed by the
		  rector and professors of St. Andrews University authorising James Gregory to
		  provide mathematical and astronomical instruments for use in the University,
		  1673, at La.II.580; and, portrait of Gregory discussed in a letter, at
		  La.II.588. There are other references to material relating to the talented but
		  complicated Gregory family (check the Indexes for more details). The Gregorys
		  were descended from the Rev. John Gregory, Minister of Drumoak. The inventor
		  David Gregory (1627-1720) and mathematician James Gregory (1638-1675), the
		  Elder, were his sons. In turn, David's son was the astronomer and Professor of
		  Mathematics David Gregory (1661-1708), and James' son was James Gregory (d.
		  1731), Professor of Medicine at King's College, Aberdeen. The son of the King's
		  College Gregory was John Gregory (1724-1773), Professor of Medicine at
		  Edinburgh University, and in turn his son was James Gregory (1753-1821)
		  Professor of Medicine, Edinburgh University.</p> 
		<p>See the HE Archives Hub for descriptions of the Edinburgh University
		  Library collections 'Papers of David Gregory (1661-1708)' and 'Lectures and
		  Cases of Professor James Gregory (1753-1821)' and 'Papers of Professor John
		  Gregory (1724-1773)'.</p> 
		<p>In addition, for James Gregory (1638-1675), the Elder, the UK National
		  Register of Archives (NRA), updated by the Historical Manuscripts Commission,
		  notes these other collections: papers, British Library, Manuscript Collections,
		  Ref. Sloane MS 3208; correspondence with John Collins, 1667-1675, Private;
		  correspondence with John Collins, 1668-1675, St. Andrews University Library;
		  and, correspondence with John Collins etc, 1669-1674, Royal Society.</p>
