		<p>The Scottish poet, Alexander Anderson, was born in Kirkconnel, a
		  village by the River Nith, in Dumfriesshire, on 30 April 1845. He was educated
		  at Crocketford, Kirkcudbrightshire, to where the family had moved when he was
		  aged three. Later on, when he was sixteen, the family moved back to Kirkconnel.
		  Anderson first started his working life at a quarry, then he became a
		  surfaceman, or navvy, on the Glasgow and South-Western Railway. During the
		  sixteen years he worked as a surfacemen he read and studied and taught himself
		  French language and grammar, acquired a knowledge of German, Italian and
		  Spanish, and wrote poetry. On his first appearance in print - in 
		<title>The People's Friend</title> a Thomson title, in Dundee - he became
		recognised as a local poet. By the early-1880s, Anderson was in Edinburgh. He
		was Secretary to the Edinburgh Philosophical Institution, 1883-1886, and he was
		also Assistant Librarian at Edinburgh University, 1880-1883, and 1886-1905. His
		publications include 
		<title>A song of labour and other poems</title> (1873), 
		<title>The two angels and other poems</title> (1875), 
		<title>Songs of the rail</title> (1878), and 
		<title>Ballads and sonnets</title> (1899). Also, while still a
		surfaceman, he translated several of the poems of Heinrich Heine (1797-1856)
		from German. Anderson travelled widely in Scotland and many of his poems
		reflect this, with titles such as 
		<title>A Nithsdale idyll</title> and 
		<title>The hills and burns at hame</title>. Many of his Scottish poems
		were about child life, 
		<title>Cuddle doon</title>, 
		<title>The bogie man</title>, and 
		<title>The sand man</title>. Alexander Anderson died on 11 July 1909. His
		
		<title>Later poems</title> were published in 1912 after his death.</p>
