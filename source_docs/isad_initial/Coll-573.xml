		<p>L. C. Wood was a missionary with the China Inland Mission in the
		  region of Ningsia, north-west China. He arrived in China around the early 1920s
		  and worked there with his wife until he left in January 1943. On his return to
		  England he gave talks and slide shows about the mission in China.</p> 
	 </bioghist> 
	 <scopecontent> 
		<p>The collection consists of 69 colour slides (5 cm x 5cm) with a full
		  commentary for a lantern talk entitled 
		<title>A preaching walk through the Ningsia district</title> given by
		Wood in England depicting scenes of life in China, church and mission work and
		missionaries and church leaders; and an album of 20 coloured photographs of
		scenes in Peking.</p> 
	 </scopecontent> 
	 <arrangement> 
		<p>The slides are in order but some are missing and some do not seem to
		  have a description in the commentary. They are numbered but the numbers do not
		  always relate to the numbers in the commentary. The photographs are
		  captioned.</p> 
	 </arrangement> 
	 <custodhist> 
		<p>The collection was briefly listed by Ralph Covell in 1992.</p> 
	 </custodhist> 
	 <acqinfo> 
		<p>The slides were probably presented to the Centre for the Study of
		  Christianity in the Non-Western world by A. J. Broomhall when he presented
		  other CIM slides.</p>
