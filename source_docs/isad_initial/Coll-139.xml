		<p>James Fleetwood was baptised at Chalfont St. Giles on 25 April 1603.
		  He was educated at Eton and then at King's College, Cambridge. In 1632 he was
		  appointed Chaplain to the Bishop of Lichfield. During the Civil War in England,
		  Fleetwood attached himself as Chaplain to the regiment of John, Earl of Rivers,
		  and his contribution during the Battle of Edgehill earned him from King Charles
		  the degree of D.D. from Oxford in November 1642. He was then given the Rectory
		  of Sutton Coldfield but this was later withdrawn from him by Parliament. He was
		  made tutor to Prince Charles, and on the Restoration he was appointed Chaplain
		  in Ordinary. He was also given the Rectory of Anstey in Hertfordshire and of
		  Denham in Buckinghamshire. In 1663 and 1667 Fleetwood was Vice-Chancellor of
		  Cambridge University, and on 29 August 1675 he was consecrated as Bishop of
		  Worcester at the Church of St. Peter le Poer, Broad Street, London. James
		  Fleetwood, Bishop of Worcester, died on 17 July 1683.</p>
