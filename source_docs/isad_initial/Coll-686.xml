		<p>Novelist and playwright Christopher Isherwood (Christopher William
		  Bradshaw-Isherwood) was born in Disley, Cheshire, on 26 August 1904. He was
		  educated at St Edmunds School, Hindhead, Surrey, which was a preparatory
		  school, and at Repton School. He studied first at Corpus Christi College,
		  Cambridge, from 1924, though he did not take his degree. He then studied
		  medicine at King's College London, 1928-29. He gave this up however, and after
		  the publication of his first novel 
		<title>All the conspirators</title> (1928), he went to Germany and taught
		English in Berlin, 1930-1933. For a time he was a journalist in London,
		1934-1936 and he also did film-script work for Gaumont-British. In 1938
		Isherwood travelled to China with W. H. Auden, a long-time friend from prep'
		school days. Indeed when Erika Mann (daughter of Thomas Mann) approached him
		with the suggestion that she marry him to obtain a British passport, the
		unwilling Isherwood approached Auden who did agree to marry her in 1935. In
		1939, he emigrated to California to be a scriptwriter for Metro-Goldwyn-Meyer,
		and in 1946 he took US citizenship. Auden too had emigrated to the USA and took
		American citizenship. In 1947, Isherwood stayed in Quito, Ecuador, during a
		tour of several months in South America. Other works by Isherwood include 
		<title>The memorial</title> (1932), 
		<title>Mr. Norris changes trains</title> (1935), 
		<title>Goodbye to Berlin</title> (1939) upon which the musical 
		<title>Cabaret</title> was based, 
		<title>Prater Violet</title> (1945), 
		<title>The world in the evening</title> (1954), and 
		<title>Down there on a visit</title> (1962). With Auden he wrote 
		<title>The dog beneath the skin</title> (1935), 
		<title>Ascent of F6</title> (1937), 
		<title>On the frontier</title> (1938), and 
		<title>Journey to a war</title> (1939). Isherwood became interested in
		the teaching of Swami Prabhavananda and he also co-translated with him, 
		<title>The Bhagavad-Gita</title> (1944), 
		<title>Shankara's crest-jewel of discrimination</title> (1947), and 
		<title>How to know God. The yogi aphorisms of Patanjali</title> (1953).
		Many of his famous literary friends appeared in his books under different
		names, including Auden, Stephen Spender, and Virginia Woolf. Isherwood became a
		leading spokesman for gay rights and he was one of the first internationally
		known figures to admit that he was homosexual. His relationship with Don
		Bachardy - who became a portraitist and later Los Angeles bon vivant, and who
		together with Isherwood in 1968, was painted by David Hockney - continued for
		over thirty years until Isherwood's death. Christopher Isherwood died in Santa
		Monica on 4 January 1986.</p>
