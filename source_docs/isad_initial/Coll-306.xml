		<p>The preacher and critic Hugh Blair was born in Edinburgh on 7 April
		  1718. He entered Edinburgh University in 1730, graduating in 1738 or 1739 with
		  the degree of M.A. and writing a thesis entitled 
		<title>De fundamentis et obligatione legis naturae</title>. In 1741,
		Blair became licensed to preach and held successively a parish in Fife, Lady
		Yester's Church in Edinburgh, Canongate Parish in the city, and Edinburgh's St.
		Giles'. The latter charge was given in June 1758 and he held it until his death
		in 1800.</p> 
		<p>In 1759 Blair started giving lectures on composition at Edinburgh
		  University and in 1760 he was made Professor of Rhetoric, an appointment which
		  was transferred to the Professorship of Rhetoric and Belles-Lettres in April
		  1762.</p> 
		<p>Blair was part of Edinburgh's distinguished literary circle of the
		  day, and was a contemporary of David Hume, Adam Ferguson, and Adam Smith.</p> 
		<p>Blair championed the publishing of the 
		<title>Ossian</title> fragments by James Macpherson (1736-1796). Blair's
		own lectures and sermons were translated and read widely abroad. Professor Hugh
		Blair died on 27 December 1800.</p>

	 <scopecontent> 
		<p>The papers of Professor Hugh Blair consist principally of
		  correspondence. The material includes: a letter probably to T. Cadell and to
		  William Strahan and A. Constable, between 1778 and 1796 at Dc.2.76/10 which are
		  copies from originals held by the Earl of Rosebery and 'in Edinburgh Public
		  library'; letters to Miss Nancy Ord at Gen. 1730/1 Blair; and, another letter
		  to Cadell and a letter to the Lord provost of Edinburgh at Dc.4.101 Blair.
		  There are also lectures on rheoric and the belles lettres, in manuscript, and
		  including Synopsis, taken down 1765, at Dc.10.6, and lectures, 1779, at Gen.
		  1990. There are further notes of lectures on rhetoric and belles lettres at
		  Dc.3.42, and sermons from 1800 at Dc.3.43. Included in the collection too are
		  letters (one probably to Lord Keith, 1789), another from 1783, and a note to
		  Dr. Archibald Davidson, 1788, at E95.60, E89.74, and E99.11.</p> 
		<p>At E2006.43 there is an engraved portrait of Hugh Blair, drawn by W.
		  Evans and engraved by C. Bestland. It is from an original picture by Henry
		  Raeburn in the possession of Sir John Macpherson. It was printed in 1809.</p>
