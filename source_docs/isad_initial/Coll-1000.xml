		<p>Annie T. Altschul - an Austrian by birth - arrived in Britain with her
		  mother in 1938, after the Anschluss. The Altschuls were a Jewish family. She
		  trained as a nurse in London in the 1940s, and although qualifying as a general
		  nurse and as a midwife, she found her niche in psychiatric nursing. After
		  training at Mill Hill Emergency Hospital she moved to the merged Bethlem and
		  Maudsley Hospitals and, while progressing from staff nurse to sister to
		  Principal tutor, she also took a first class honours degree in Psychology at
		  Birkbeck College, University of London. In 1964 she was appointed as a Lecturer
		  in the Department of Nursing Studies at Edinburgh University. She then became a
		  Senior Lecturer before being appointed to the Chair of Nursing Studies in
		  1976-77. Her publications include 
		<title>Psychiatric Nursing</title> (1957), and 
		<title>Psychology for Nurses</title> (1962). Altschul retired from the
		University in 1983, and on her retirement she was awarded the CBE and given the
		status of Professor Emeritus of Nursing Studies. Annie T. Altschul died on 24
		December 2001.</p>
