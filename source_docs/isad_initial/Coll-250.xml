		<p>James Gregory was born in Aberdeen in January 1753. He was the son of
		  John Gregory (1724-1773), Professor of Medicine at Edinburgh University, who
		  was at that time practicing medicine in Aberdeen. James Gregory was educated at
		  Aberdeen and Edinburgh, and also at Christ Church, Oxford. On the death of his
		  father in 1773, Gregory took over his father's lectures at Edinburgh University
		  with some success, and took his own M.D. in 1774. After spending a couple of
		  years studying medicine in continental Europe, Gregory was appointed Professor
		  of the Institutes of Medicine in 1776 and the following year he began giving
		  clinical lectures at the Royal Infirmary. His two volume 
		<title>Conspectus medicinae theoreticae: ad usum academicum</title>
		(1782) established his position in medicine and in 1790 he became Professor of
		the Practice of Medicine at Edinburgh University, succeeding William Cullen
		(1710-1790) who had held the Chair since the death of Gregory's father.
		Professor James Gregory died on 2 April 1821. </p>
