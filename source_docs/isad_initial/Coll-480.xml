		<p>Andrew Rutherfurd was born on 13 December 1791. He was educated at the
		  Royal High School in Edinburgh and then studied at Edinburgh University. He
		  became an advocate in 1812 and soon built up a practice. In 1833 he was
		  appointed as a member of the Commission of Inquiry into the State of the Laws
		  and Judicatories of Scotland. In 1837, during Lord Melbourne's second
		  administration, Rutherfurd was appointed Solicitor-General for Scotland. In
		  1839 he was promoted to Lord Advocate and also became the MP for Leith Burghs.
		  In 1840 he saw the Bill for the Amendment of the Scottish Law of Evidence
		  through the Commons. In 1845 he was installed as Rector of Glasgow University,
		  and that same year he spoke in Edinburgh in favour of the repeal of the Corn
		  Laws. He had resigned as Lord Advocate when Sir Robert Peel came to power in
		  1841 but was re-appointed by Lord Russell in 1846. Andrew, Lord Rutherfurd,
		  died on 13 December 1854. </p>
