		<p>Samuel Bailey was born in 1791 and was educated first by his maternal
		  grandfather and then at the Moravian school of Fulneck. He then worked
		  alongside his father who was a master cutler in Sheffield. He visited America
		  to establish commercial connections, but his attentions and interests were
		  caught not by business but by literary and political pursuits. From 1821 he
		  began publishing essays and in 1828 he began a political career but with little
		  success. Bailey was President of the Sheffield Literary and Philosophical
		  Society and he became chairman of the Sheffield Banking Company which he had
		  helped found in 1831. Bailey's publications include 
		<title>Essays on the formation and publication of opinions and other
		  subjects</title> (1821), 
		<title>Critical dissertation on the nature, measure, and causes of
		  value</title> (1825), 
		<title>Essays on the pursuit of truth and on the progress of
		  knowledge</title> (1829), 
		<title>Rationale of political representation</title> (1835), 
		<title>Theory of reasoning</title> (1851), and in 1861 and 1862 two
		volumes on Shakespeare's writing. He also wrote 
		<title>Letters from an Egyptian Kafir on a visit to England in search of
		  religion</title> (1837) and the poem 
		<title>Maro, or poetic sensibility</title> (1846). Samuel Bailey died on
		18 January 1870. </p>
