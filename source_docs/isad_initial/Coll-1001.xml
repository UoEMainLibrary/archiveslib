		<p>Edward Sang was born in Fife on 30 January 1805. He went to school in
		  Kirkcaldy and already as a boy he showed an inclination towards mathematics. In
		  1818, Sang joined Edinburgh University when still a teenager, and studied
		  mathematics. On leaving the University in 1822 he followed a career as a
		  surveyor and civil engineer, and then became a teacher of mathematics in
		  Edinburgh. In 1828, Sang was elected a Fellow of the Royal Scottish Society of
		  Arts and he brought before the Society over one hundred papers on a wide
		  variety of subjects covering mathematics, natural philosophy, astronomy, and
		  engineering. In 1841 he became Professor of Mechanical Science at Manchester
		  New College, and shortly after that he travelled to Istanbul to help in the
		  establishment of civil engineering in Turkey and in the building of railways
		  there. In 1849 Sang was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In
		  1856 he read a paper on the gyroscope in relation to his suggestion of an
		  experiment that would demonstrate the rotation of the Earth. Sang claimed that
		  he had proved this by an experiment in 1836, pre-dating the experiment
		  performed by Foucault. Edward Sang died on 23 December 1890 </p>

	 <scopecontent encodinganalog="isad(g) 3.3.1./marc 520"> 
		<p>The works of Edward Sang include 13 volumes of logarithms and 26
		  miscellaneous volumes on a variety of mathematical subjects including geometry
		  and algebra, trigonometry, the theory of variables, driving belt calculations,
		  and load-bearing calculations for the Forth Bridge. There is also a volume on 
		<title>The teeth of wheels </title>. </p> 
		<p>Evidence of Sang's surveying/civil engineering is shown in the plans
		  of the policies of Mount Melville, 1818 (estate in Cameron, Fife, owned by John
		  Whyte-Melville 1797-1883). These are shown in 5 figures contained in plan
		  folder measuring 53cms by 41 cms. The plans show the grounds, a plan of Mount
		  Melville Garden, and the estate hot-houses .</p>
