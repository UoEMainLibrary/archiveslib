		<p>Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer was born in London on 2 June 1850. He
		  began his career at University College, London, where he became Assistant
		  Professor of Physiology, 1874-1883, then Jodrell Professor of Zoology and
		  Anatomy at University College, 1883-1899. Between 1899 and 1933,
		  Sharpey-Schafer was Professor of Physiology at Edinburgh University. His most
		  striking work was that associated with the endocrine organs and his
		  observations on cutaneous sensation were also important. Sharpey-Schafer's name
		  is associated too with the Schafer method of artificial respiration. Apart from
		  many journal articles he has published the 
		<title>Essentials of histology</title>, a 
		<title>Text-book of physiology</title>, and 
		<title>The endocrine organs</title>. Professor Sir Edward Albert
		Sharpey-Schafer died on 29 March 1935.</p>
