		<p>Charles Edward Rhodes Bruce was born in Shettleston, Glasgow, on 19
		  April 1902. He was educated in the village school at Newport, Fife, where he
		  spent his childhood, followed by two years at Dundee High School and five years
		  at Edinburgh University where he finished with First Class Honours in
		  Mathematics and Natural Philosophy. After attending Moray House Teachers'
		  Training College, Edinburgh, Bruce joined the Electrical Research Association
		  in 1924. At the ERA he made significant contributions to the early development
		  of arc physics which in turn laid the foundations for the revolution in
		  circuit-breaker technology led by ERA in the 1930s. His work set out in papers
		  including one in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, made possible
		  significant improvements in procedures for protection against lightning. He
		  received the degree of D.Sc. from Edinburgh University. Bruce frequently wrote
		  for journals in his field including 
		<title>Nature</title>, 
		<title>Journal of the Institute of Electrical Engineers</title>, 
		<title>The Engineer</title>, 
		<title>Electronics and power</title>, 
		<title>The observatory</title>, 
		<title>Discovery</title>, and the 
		<title>Journal of the Electrical Research Association</title>. He retired
		from the ERA in 1967. Dr Charles E. R. Bruce died on 30 December 1979.</p>
