		<p>Physician and botanist, Daniel Rutherford was born in Edinburgh on 3
		  November 1749. He was the son of Professor John Rutherford (1695-1779). He was
		  educated first at home and then in England, and then studied at Edinburgh
		  University. He graduated with the degree of M.A. then began a course of medical
		  study under William Cullen (1710-1790) and Joseph Black (1728-1799), obtaining
		  his M.D. in 1772 through a dissertation entitled 
		<title>De aere fixo dicto aut Mephitico</title>. This work established a
		distinction between carbonic acid gas and nitrogen, and paralleled the work
		being done at the same time by Joseph Priestley (1733-1804). On the publication
		of his paper and on the completion of his university study, Rutherford
		travelled in England, France and Italy, and then in 1775 returned to Edinburgh
		where he began to practise. He became a Licentiate of the Royal College of
		Physicians of Edinburgh in 1776, and a Fellow in 1777, and was President
		between 1796 and 1798. Previously, in 1786, He succeeded Dr. John Hope as
		Professor of Botany at Edinburgh University, and Keeper of the Royal Botanic
		Garden in the city (then sited at the top of Leith Walk). Rutherford had also
		been nominated a member of the Faculty of Medicine and had connections with the
		Royal Infirmary as a Clinical Professor. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society
		of Edinburgh and also of the Linnean Society. In addition to 
		<title>De aere fixo dicto aut Mephitico</title> (1772), he published a
		paper containing 
		<title>A description of an improved thermometer</title> in Volume 3 of
		the 
		<title>Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh</title>, and 
		<title>Characteres generum plantarum ex systemate vegetabilium Linnaei et
		  Horto Kewensi praecipue excerpti</title> (1793). Professor Daniel Rutherford
		died on 15 November 1819. He was a maternal uncle of Sir Walter Scott
		(1771-1832).</p>
