		<p>George Wilson was born in Edinburgh in 1818. He was the younger
		  brother of Sir Daniel Wilson (1816-1892). He was educated at the city's Royal
		  High School. After leaving school he later on, in 1838, became a laboratory
		  assistant to Dr. Thomas Graham (1805-1869) at the University College, London.
		  He took his M.D. at Edinburgh University in 1839 and was qualified by the Royal
		  College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. Wilson then became an extra-mural lecturer on
		  chemistry. He also owned a congregational church belonging to an independent
		  section. In 1855 he became Regius Professor of Technology at Edinburgh
		  University and also Director of the Scottish Industrial Museum (now known as
		  the Royal Scottish Museum, Chambers Street). His publications include 
		<title>Life of Henry Cavendish</title> (1851), 
		<title>Researches on colour-blindedness</title> (1855), and 
		<title>The five gateways of knowledge</title> (1856). He also wrote on
		religious subjects. Professor George Wilson died in 1859.</p>
