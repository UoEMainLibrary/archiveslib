		<p>In the seventeenth century, nearly all newspapers referred to their
		  goal of offering 'intelligence, both foreign and domestic'. An 'intelligencer'
		  was a news gatherer and newsmonger . One of the earliest general-circulation
		  newspapers in England was the 
		<title>Mercurius Britannicus,</title> published in 1641, and its Monday
		edition carried the alternative title 
		<title> The English Intelligencer</title>. Another early paper was the 
		<title>Kingdoms Intelligencer</title> published for two years beginning
		in 1661 by the English Parliament in opposition to the king. There were other
		publications called the 
		<title>German Intelligencer</title>, the 
		<title>Swedish Intelligencer</title> printed in 1632, and the 
		<title>Orange Intelligencer</title>. The 
		<title>Swedish Intelligencer</title> was perhaps the first real
		illustrated newspaper. In one issue it gave full accounts of the exploits of
		the Swedish King, Gustavus Adolphus (Gustaf II Adolf), and was illustrated with
		his portrait, a bird's eye view of the siege of Magdeburg, a plan showing how
		he and his army crossed the river Lech into Bavaria, and a plan or bird's eye
		view of the battle of Lutzen, where he was killed. The portrait, the siege of
		Magdeburg, and the battle of Lutzen were copper engravings, but the passage of
		the Lech was a woodcut. The content was derived from pamphlets, letters and
		reports from English officers and it also contained poems about the King. The
		earliest use of the English word 'plunder' from the German 'plundern' was in
		the 
		<title>Swedish Intelligencer</title>. The newspaper appeared in four
		parts between 1632 and 1633 and after that it underwent title changes between
		1633 and 1635.</p>
