		<p>German physician Johann Abraham Albers was born in Bremen on 20 March
		  1772. He studied medicine in Goettingen and in Jena and was awarded his
		  doctorate in 1795. He then made a study journey around Germany and in England
		  before returning to his home city in 1798 to start practicing. While he was
		  abroad he became interested in hospital reform. He also carried out comparative
		  anatomical research into the eyes of birds and marine animals, and concerned
		  himself with obstetrics and paediatrics. He engaged in rich correspondence with
		  other physicians and scientists both in Germany and abroad, and wrote for the
		  Edinburgh 
		<title>Annals of medicine</title>. Albers participated in the translation
		from French and publication of 
		<title>Abhandlung ueber den Croup</title> (1816), and was responsible for
		
		<title>Commentatio de tracheitide infantum vulgo croup vocata</title>
		(1816). Johann Abraham Albers died on 24 March 1821.</p>
