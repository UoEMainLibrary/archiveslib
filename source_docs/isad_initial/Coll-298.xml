		<p>George Joseph Bell was born in the Fountainbridge district of
		  Edinburgh on 26 March 1770. He was the elder brother of Professor Sir Charles
		  Bell (1774-1842). Like his brother, he was educated at home though he also
		  attended some lectures at Edinburgh University, certainly in 1788. He was
		  admitted as an advocate in 1791, and having devoted himself to the systematic
		  study of Scottish mercantile law he published the two volumes of 
		<title>A treatise on the laws of bankruptcy in Scotland</title> (1804).
		This was followed by an enlarged and improved version with the title 
		<title>Commentaries on the laws of Scotland and on the principles of
		  mercantile jurisprudence considered in relation to bankruptcy, compositions of
		  creditors, and imprisonment for debt</title> (1810). In 1822, Bell was
		appointed as Professor of Scots Law at Edinburgh University, and in 1823 he was
		commissioned to report on the forms of process in the Scottish courts of law
		and the course of appeals from the Scottish Court of Session to the House of
		Lords. This led to the Scottish Judicature Act of 1825. In 1833 he was
		appointed Chairman of the Commission looking at draft proposals for the
		amendment of Scottish law relating to bankruptcy proceedings. The report led to
		the Scottish Bankruptcy Act, 1839. Bell's other publications included 
		<title>Principles of the law of Scotland, for the use of students in the
		  University of Edinburgh</title> (1829), and the three volumes of 
		<title>Illustrations from adjudged cases of the principles of the law of
		  Scotland</title> (1836). George Joseph Bell died in 1843.</p>

		<p>The collection consists of what are believed to be notes of lectures
		  on Scots Law delivered by Professor David Hume, 1788, and taken down by George
		  Joseph Bell, at Dc.5.37-38. There are also notes of lectures on Scots Law
		  delivered by Bell, 1836-1837, at Dk.2.4. </p>
