		<p>Peter Hadland Davis was born in 1981. He came to Edinburgh University
		  in 1945 after serving in Palestine and Egypt during the Second World War. He
		  took a First Class Honours degree then a Ph.D. and was appointed to the
		  academic staff. In addition, a 1963 D.Sc. thesis by Davis was entitled 
		<title>Contributions to the flora of Turkey</title>. During the War he
		had become interested in the plants and people of South West Asia and North
		Africa and so with the help of funding he began to research and produce his
		great work, the 
		<title>Flora of Turkey and the east Aegean islands</title>, travelling
		extensively again in Turkey and North Africa. Davis was appointed Professor of
		Plant Taxonomy at Edinburgh University and was the Honorary Curator at the
		Royal Botanic Garden in the city. His publications include 
		<title>Flora of Turkey and the east Aegean islands</title> (1965-1988),
		with J. Cullen 
		<title>The identification of flowering plant families: including a key to
		  those native and cultivated in north temperate regions</title>, and with V. H.
		Heywood 
		<title>Principles of angiosperm taxonomy</title> (circa 1963). Professor
		Peter Hadland Davis died in 1992.</p>
