		<p>Alexander Keith, writer on prophecy, was born in Aberdeenshire on 30
		  November 1791. He was educated at Marischal College (now part of Aberdeen
		  University) and at Aberdeen University, from 1805 to 1809. He was licensed to
		  preach by the Presbytery of Garioch in 1813 and was ordained at St. Cyrus,
		  Kincardineshire in 1816. In 1839 he was sent by the Church of Scotland to
		  participate in a commission of inquiry into the state of the Jews, which
		  required a visit to Palestine and eastern Europe. He again visited Palestine in
		  1844 with his physician son, George. In 1843, Keith ceased to be a Minister of
		  the established Church of Scotland, and joined the secessionist Free Church of
		  Scotland. He repeatedly turned down offers of the Moderatorship of the Free
		  Church. His publications include 
		<title>Sketch of the evidence of prophecy</title> (1823), 
		<title>Evidence of the truth of the Christian religion from the
		  fulfilment of prophecy</title> (1828), 
		<title>The signs of the times, illustrated by the fulfilment of
		  historical predictions</title> (1832), 
		<title>The land of Israel according to the covenant with Abraham, with
		  Isaac, and with Jacob</title> (1843), 
		<title>The harmony of prophecy</title> (1851). Alexander Keith died in
		Buxton, Derbyshire, on 8 February 1880. He was buried at Chinley,
		Chapel-en-le-Frith. </p>
