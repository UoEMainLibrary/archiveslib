		<p>James Home was born in 1760. He was the son of Professor Francis Home
		  (1719-1813). He graduated from Edinburgh University, and his dissertation
		  published in 1781 was entitled 
		<title>Dissertatio ... de scorbuto</title>. In 1798 he succeeded his
		father as Professor of Materia Medica at Edinburgh University. He was so
		successful that he raised attendance in his classes sixfold. On the death of
		Dr. James Gregory (1753-1821) he received the Chair of Physic, a post he held
		less successfully. Home was President of the Royal College of Physicians,
		Edinburgh. Professor James Home died on 5 December 1844.</p>
