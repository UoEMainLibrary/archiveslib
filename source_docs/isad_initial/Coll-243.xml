		<p>David Playfair Heatley was born in Northumbria in 1867. He was
		  educated at Edinburgh's Royal High School and then studied in the Arts at
		  Edinburgh University from 1884 until 1890, but did not graduate. Until 1892, he
		  carried out research at the University looking at Northumbria at the time of
		  Aidan. His subsequent career was spent in teaching History at Edinburgh
		  University. Heatley was an Assistant from 1892, a Lecturer in Modern History
		  and Political Science from 1900, and Reader in Political Science from 1920
		  until 1935. He was also Official Adviser in Arts between 1907 and 1915, and was
		  a member of Senatus, 1924 to 1935. Heatley also represented the Civil Service
		  Commissioners on committees for appointments for several years. His
		  publications, often written under the pseudonym of Politicus, include 
		<title>Studies in British history and politics</title> (1913), 
		<title>Diplomacy and the study of international relations</title> (1919),
		and 
		<title>Viscount Grey of Fallodon</title> (1934). David Playfair Heatley
		died at Rothbury, Northumberland, on 20 September 1944.</p>
