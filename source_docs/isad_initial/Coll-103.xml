		<p>James Orchard Halliwell was born in Sloane Street, in London's
		  Chelsea, on 21 June 1820. He was educated at private schools, and showed an
		  aptitude for mathematics. In his teen years, he began to collect books and
		  manuscripts. In November 1837 he matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge,
		  but in April 1838 he transferred to Jesus College. There, he was awarded a
		  mathematical prize and scholarship, and he acted as Librarian. In 1839, before
		  he was nineteen years of age, he was elected a Fellow of the Society of
		  Antiquaries, and then Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1840, Halliwell left
		  Cambridge after the Lent term, without a degree, and settled in London. By
		  then, he had collected around 130 early manuscripts, mainly dealing with
		  mathematics and astrology, but these had to be sold under pressure from
		  creditors. In London he worked in the Library of the British Museum and
		  continued buying books and manuscripts. It was his purchase and collection of
		  manuscripts that, in 1844, led to serious charges against him of abstracting
		  material from Trinity College. Throughout his life, he was an insatiable
		  collector of rare books and manuscripts. Halliwell was also an energetic member
		  of the many literary societies founded at the time - the Camden Society, the
		  Percy Society, the Shakespeare Society. To the latter he contributed many short
		  essays. In 1841, Halliwell came to the attention of antiquary and bibliophile
		  Sir Thomas Phillipps (1792-1872). He soon became a house guest and in 1842
		  Halliwell married the eldest daughter of Sir Thomas Phillipps, after which he
		  assumed the name of James Orchard Halliwell-Phillipps. Also at this time, he
		  began to concentrate his attention on the life of Shakespeare and the text of
		  Shakespeare's works. His publication record as a whole includes works on
		  archaeology, folklore, balladry, philology, and history, and some notable works
		  are 
		<title>A brief account of the life, writings and inventions of Sir Samuel
		  Morland: master of mechanics to Charles the Second </title> (1838), 
		<title>An introduction to the Midsummer Night's Dream, an essay on the
		  character of Falstaff and Shakesperiana </title> (1841), 
		<title>Dictionary of archaic and provincial words, obsolete phrases,
		  proverbs, and ancient customs from the fourteenth century </title> (1846), 
		<title>New boke about Shakespeare and Stratford-upon-Avon </title>
		(1850), 
		<title>The complete works of Shakspere: revised from the original
		  editions </title> (1850), and 
		<title>Outlines of a life of Shakespeare </title> (1881). In the course
		of his literary researches he often had occasion to communicate with David
		Laing (1793-1878), historian, antiquary, bibliographer, and collector. James O.
		Halliwell-Phillipps died on 3 January 1889. </p>

		<p>The Halliwell-Phillipps Collection includes 16th-century works by
		  Italian, French and Spanish authors. Its strength lies in English books
		  however, especially English drama of the 17th and 18th centuries. The
		  Collection also includes more than 600 plays including works by Ben Jonson,
		  Beaumont and Fletcher, George Chapman, Thomas Middleton, John Webster, John
		  Dryden, Philip Massinger, and William Wycherley. Several are playhouse copies
		  with contemporary stage directions added in manuscript. There are circa 300
		  volumes containing around 15,000 letters of authors, circa 100 volumes of
		  assorted Shakespeare scraps, literary cuttings, diaries, notes and cuttings on
		  collections, and lists of records. </p>

		<p>In 1872, James Orchard Halliwell-Phillips wrote to the Principal of
		  Edinburgh University offering to present his Shakespearean library. This was
		  accepted and the major part of the collection came to in 1872, and large
		  additions followed in 1873 and later. In May 1964, at Sotheby's, Edinburgh
		  University Library purchased the Halliwell-Phillipps Collection previously
		  given to the private subscription Penzance Library. The purchase consisted of
		  over six hundred items. </p>
