		<p>Thomas Guthrie was born in Brechin, Angus, on 12 July 1803. He was the
		  son of a trader and banker in the town. Guthrie was educated in Brechin and
		  then studied at Edinburgh University between 1815 and 1825 following arts and
		  linguistics courses, philosophy and mathematics, divinity and biblical
		  criticism, church history, Hebrew, and medical and scientific studies. In 1825
		  he was licensed to preach by the presbytery of Brechin but was not ordained
		  until 1830. Meanwhile, in 1826 he went to Paris and studied natural philosophy,
		  chemistry and comparative anatomy at the Sorbonne. In 1830 Guthrie was ordained
		  as Minister of Arbirlot, near Arbroath. While there he took a strong interest
		  in the farming and weaving community and established a savings bank, parish
		  library and Sunday school. In 1837 he was ordained as a Minister of Old
		  Greyfriars Church in Edinburgh and in 1840 he was appointed to St. John's
		  parish. His sermons and preaching in the city attracted large congregations at
		  a time of great disruption in the Church of Scotland. </p> 
		<p>During the Disruption which came to a head on 18 May 1843, Guthrie
		  supported the theologian Thomas Chalmers (1780-1847) in his opposition to
		  intrusion by the civil authority into church government and was among over four
		  hundred ministers who seceded from the Church of Scotland to set up the Free
		  Church of Scotland. In 1843, Guthrie became Minister of the Free St. John's
		  Church in the city and set about raising money to build manses (residences) for
		  other Free Church ministers who obviously had to leave their Church of Scotland
		  manses. In one year, he managed to raise one hundred and sixteen thousand
		  pounds.</p> 
		<p>Apart from his support of Chalmers and his role in church politics, he
		  was an advocate of compulsory education and took a leading part in the call for
		  a national system of education which eventually led to the Scottish Education
		  Act 1872. From his earliest work in Edinburgh among the poorest people living
		  in the city's wynds and closes, Guthrie realised that effort would have to be
		  invested into setting up 'ragged schools'. His 
		<title>Plea for ragged schools</title> (1847) led to their
		establishment.</p> 
		<p>Another of Guthrie's causes was that of abstinence, becoming himself a
		  total abstainer in 1844. Through sermons, speeches and pamphlets, a prolonged
		  fight led to the Forbes Mackenzie Act, 1853, which brought Sunday closing to
		  public-houses in Scotland. Guthrie was made Moderator of the General Assembly
		  of the Free Church of Scotland in 1862. He retired from active work in the
		  Church in 1864 Thomas Guthrie died in Edinburgh on 24 February 1873.</p>
