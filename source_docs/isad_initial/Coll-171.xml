		<p>John Chiene was born in Edinburgh in 1843. He was educated at
		  Edinburgh Academy and then studied medicine at Edinburgh University where he
		  graduated in 1865. He became a Licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons,
		  Edinburgh, around the same time. Study in Paris followed and on his return to
		  Edinburgh he became a demonstrator of anatomy in the University Anatomical
		  Department. He then became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons and joined
		  the staff of the New Town Dispensary in 1868. Chiene was appointed Assistant
		  Surgeon at the Royal Infirmary in 1871 and shortly after that started teaching
		  surgery. In 1882 he was appointed Professor of Surgery at Edinburgh University.
		  During the Boer War he served in South Africa as a Consulting Surgeon to the
		  Field Forces. Mentioned in dispatches, he received the appropriate medal.
		  Chiene was also awarded the C.B. His publications include 
		<title>Lectures on surgical anatomy</title> (1878), and 
		<title>The principles of surgery</title> (1882). Chiene resigned his
		Chair at the University in 1909. Professor John Chiene died in Barnton,
		Edinburgh, on 29 May 1923</p>
