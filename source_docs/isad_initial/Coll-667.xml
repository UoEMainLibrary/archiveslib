		<p>Joseph Farquharson was born in Edinburgh on 4 May 1846. He started
		  painting as a boy and was taught art by the Scottish landscape painter Peter
		  Graham R.A. (1836-1921), a family friend. In 1862 or thereabouts he entered the
		  Board of Manufacturers School in Edinburgh, and later, in 1880 he studied in
		  Paris under Carolus Duran (1838-1917). Between 1885 and 1893 he made a number
		  of visits to Egypt and these influenced his work which included 
		<title>The Egyptian</title> and 
		<title>On the banks of the Nile outside Cairo</title>. Farquharson's
		first Royal Academy exhibit was 
		<title>Day's dying glow</title> (1873). His snow scenes were famed and he
		was said to have an understanding of both people and landscape. He painted snow
		and winter, sandy atmospheres, North African bazaars, and the Scottish
		Highlands. He is represented at the Tate, the National Gallery of Scotland,
		Scottish National Portrait Gallery, and in Aberdeen, Bristol, Manchester, and
		elsewhere in Britain. Joseph Farquharson R. A. died at Finzean, Aberdeenshire,
		on 15 April 1935.</p>
