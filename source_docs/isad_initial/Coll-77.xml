		<p>John Orr was born in Launceston, Tasmania on 4 June 1885. He was
		  educated at the High School, Launceston, and at the University of Tasmania. In
		  1905 he won a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford, Balliol College, and graduated in
		  1910 with Honours in Classical Moderations and in Law. Orr then went on to
		  study Romance Languages and Literature at the Sorbonne and at Florence and took
		  the Oxford B.Litt. in 1913. Between 1913 and 1915 he was a Lecturer in French
		  at Manchester University and from 1915 to 1918 he was a Lecturer in French at
		  East London College. In addition, during the First World War he served in the
		  Naval and Military Intelligence Departments in France. At the end of the war he
		  became Professor of French at the Victoria University of Manchester and then in
		  1933 became Professor of French at Edinburgh University. Developments within
		  the Department led to the establishment in 1951 of a second Chair at Edinburgh,
		  and to a division of the field of study. Professor Orr's Chair was given the
		  new title of French Language and Romance Linguistics and the other was entitled
		  French Literature. From 1951, Orr was also Dean of the Faculty of Arts until
		  his retirement in 1954. Earlier, in 1945, his work as the Chairman of the
		  Edinburgh-Caen Fellowship was recognised by the University of Caen with the
		  award of Docteur Honoris Causa. Between 1963 and 1966 he was President of the
		  International Federation of Modern languages and Literature. Among his
		  publications were, 
		<title>An introduction to Romance classics </title> translated and
		revised from the Rumanian version by I. Iordan (1937), 
		<title>Le Lai de l'Ombre </title> (1948), 
		<title>Contes et poemes by J. Supervielle </title> (1950), 
		<title>Words and sounds in English and French </title> (1953), 
		<title>Old French and modern English idiom </title> (1961). Professor
		John Orr died on 10 August 1966. </p>
