		<p>Peacehill (or Peasehill) lies close to Wormit and the railway line
		  approach to the Tay Rail Bridge on the south bank of the River Tay in Fife. The
		  history of the Reid association in the area has its roots in the farming career
		  of David Reid (1769-1882) who was the tenant of Cruivie after farming at
		  Todhall. Cruivie lies around 4 miles south east of Peacehill, midway between
		  the communities of Kilmany and Balmullo, Fife. His eldest son Alexander Reid
		  (1818-1882) then farmed at Cruivie and also at Priorletham and Little Kinnear,
		  and his younger son David Reid (1820-1884) became tenant of Peacehill. At
		  Cruivie farming was continued by Alexander's son David Reid (1860-1917), then
		  by J. D. Graeme Reid. At Peacehill the Reid association continued with David
		  Reid (1865-1933). The brothers of this younger David Reid, Frank Reid
		  (1869-1902) and George Reid (1871-1964), became Ministers of the Church of
		  Scotland.</p>
