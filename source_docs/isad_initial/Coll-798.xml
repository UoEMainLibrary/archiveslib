		<p>The traveller and diplomat John MacDonald Kinneir was born at Carnden,
		  Linlithgow, on 3 February 1782. MacDonald was his father's name and Kinneir was
		  his mother's name. He was to became a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Honourable East
		  India Company's Civil Service. His career started with a cadetship in 1802
		  under the name of MacDonald which carried with him in the Indian army lists
		  until his death. He was appointed ensign in the Madras infantry in 1804. He was
		  a captain, lieutenant, then brevet lieutenant-colonel by 1818. He served in
		  Malabar and in Persia, and he travelled from Baghdad via Mosul and Diarbekr to
		  Istanbul, then to England via Spain and Portugal. He intended to return to
		  India through Russia and Persia (Iran) via Stockholm, but the French retreat
		  from Moscow enabled a more southerly route to be taken. His return travel took
		  him to Poland, Austria, Hungary, Istanbul, Cyprus, Armenia, Kurdistan, Baghdad,
		  and Bombay. Sir John MacDonald Kinneir died in Tabriz, Iran (then Persia) on 11
		  June 1830.</p>
