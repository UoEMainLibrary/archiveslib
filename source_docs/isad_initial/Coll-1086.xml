		<head>Administrative/Biographical History</head> 
		<p>Friedrich (Frederick) Niecks - son of an orchestral musician, teacher
		  and conductor - was born in Duesseldorf, Germany, on 3 February 1845. He was
		  educated privately in Duesseldorf and at the age of thirteen he made his first
		  appearance as a violinist at a concert of the Musikverein in the city. Until
		  1868 he was a violinist and teacher of music, still in his home city, and then
		  on the encouragement of the Scottish composer and conductor Alexander Mackenzie
		  (1847-1935) he settled in Scotland where he played viola in Mackenzie's
		  Edinburgh quartet. Niecks was also an organist and teacher of music in
		  Dumfries. By 1875 he had begun writing music and contributing to music journals
		  and between 1877 and 1878 he studied at Leipzig University. In 1880 he took
		  British nationality. In 1891 Niecks became Reid Professor of Music, and Dean of
		  the Faculty of Music, at Edinburgh University. In 1907 he married Christina
		  Struthers. His publications include 
		<title>A Concise Dictionary of musical terms </title> (1884), 
		<title>Chopin as a man and musician</title> (1888), and 
		<title>Programme music in the last four centuries </title> (1907), and
		Struthers edited his 
		<title>Robert Schumann</title> for posthumous publication in 1925. He
		retired in 1914. Professor Frederick Niecks died on 24 June 1924. </p>
