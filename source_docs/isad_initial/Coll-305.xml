		<p>John Stuart Blackie was born in Glasgow in 1809. He was educated at
		  Aberdeen and Edinburgh Universities and also in G&#x00F6;ttingen, Berlin and
		  Rome, studying first Arts and then Divinity. He then turned towards the study
		  of Law and was called to the Scottish Bar in 1834. An interest in the classics
		  and literature brought about another change in direction and in 1841 Blackie
		  became Professor of Humanity at Marischall College (Aberdeen University). He
		  held this post until 1852 when he was appointed Professor of Greek at Edinburgh
		  University. Blackie published a lot of material on philosophy, history and
		  legal subjects and he translated 
		<title>Faust</title> in 1834. He wrote much on Hellenic subjects too
		including translations of 
		<title>Aeschylus</title> (1850), the 
		<title>Iliad</title> (1866), and the 
		<title>Songs and legends of Ancient Greece</title>. He was interested in
		the reform of Scottish universities and he was a keen promoter of Scottish
		nationality raising funds for the establishment of a Chair in Celtic. Professor
		John Stuart Blackie resigned his Professorship at Edinburgh in 1882, and died
		in 1895.</p>

	 <scopecontent> 
		<p>The papers of Professor John Stuart Blackie consist largely of
		  manuscript correspondence, mostly letters and at least one postcard, among them
		  a letter to his publisher at Gen. 1733/100, a letter to the Aesthetic Club at
		  Dc.2.58, a letter to Gibson at the Royal Society of Edinburgh at Dk.6.19/4, a
		  letter denouncing English schoolmasters at Gen.1733/71, a letter about a dinner
		  in honour of Faed, at Gen. 1730/1 Blackie, a letter to Sir C. J. Pearson at
		  Gen. 756, no. 47, a letter with Blackie's favourite Greek motto at Gen.
		  1429/10/16, and a letter about Scottish music. Some letters are undated and it
		  is uncertain to whom some of the correspondence is addressed. There are printed
		  poems at Dc.4.101-103, and letters to several individuals between 1849 and 1887
		  at E89.73, E98.36, E98.47, and E98.55.</p> 
		<p>In addition there is a letter from Blackie to his nephew, possibly
		  William Walker, a postcard to William Walker from his mother, and a copy of the
		  Walker and Blackie family-tree at E2006.06.</p>
