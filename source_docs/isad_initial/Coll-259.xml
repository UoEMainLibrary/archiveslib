		<p>John Rutherford was born on 1 August 1695 in Yarrow, Selkirkshire. He
		  was educated in Selkirk and studied at Edinburgh University, 1709-1710, before
		  being apprenticed to the surgeon Alexander Nesbit with whom he remained until
		  1716. A visit to London followed, with attendance at various hospitals and
		  surgical and anatomical lectures. He then went to Leyden which had become
		  famous through the medical teaching of Hermann Boerhaave (1668-1738). At
		  Rheims, in France, in 1719, Rutherford obtained the degree of M.D. and then
		  spent some time in Paris before returning to Britain. He settled in Edinburgh
		  in 1721 and started, with partners Andrew St. Clair, John Innes, and Andrew
		  Plummer, a laboratory for the preparation of compound medicines. They also
		  taught chemistry. Each became Professors at Edinburgh University, Rutherford
		  being appointed to the Chair of the Practice of Medicine in 1726. In 1748
		  Rutherford was given permission to deliver a course of clinical lectures in the
		  Royal Infirmary. These proved to be popular, and so began the teaching
		  relationship between the University and the Royal Infirmary which gave both a
		  pre-eminence. Rutherford delivered his University lectures in Latin until 1765,
		  when he resigned to be succeeded by Dr. John Gregory (1724-1773). Professor
		  John Rutherford died in 1779 and was buried in the city's Greyfriars Churchyard
		  on 10 March 1779. He was a grandfather of Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832), and was
		  the father of Professor Daniel Rutherford (1749-1819), physician and
		  botanist.</p>
