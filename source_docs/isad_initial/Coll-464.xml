		<p>Edinburgh University Missionary Association was formed in 1825 as the
		  Edinburgh Association of Theological Students in Aid of the Diffusion of
		  Christian Knowledge. In 1828 a decision was taken to allow all Edinburgh
		  University students to join and the title Edinburgh Association of Theological
		  and Other Students in Aid of the Diffusion of Christian Knowledge was used from
		  around 1830. The Association changed its name again in 1836 when it became the
		  Edinburgh University Missionary Association (EUMA). The group met regularly,
		  often with guest speakers some of whom were well known missionaries, and
		  members paid subscriptions which were put towards the formation of a library
		  and to assist missionary activities at home and overseas. Some members became
		  missionaries themselves and remained affiliated to the Association. The group
		  was in regular correspondence with other missionary societies in Britain,
		  America and Europe. By the First World War the Association's activities had
		  expanded to included clubs and savings banks at home and funding for a medical
		  dispensary in Tibet and a training institute at Kalimpong. The Association
		  ceased to exist after the union with the New College Missionary Society in
		  1930.</p> 
		<p>The New College Missionary Society (NCMS) was formed in 1825.
		  Originally only for the Free Church students of New College its aims and
		  activities were similar to those of the EUMA, although it perhaps had more of
		  an impact. It had an active Foreign Mission Scheme raising money to support
		  missions abroad and a settlement in the Pleasance area of Edinburgh where
		  members helped to run halls and clubs and provide social, recreational and
		  religious activities for residents. In 1890 a separate Settlement Committee was
		  establish to oversee the project and members of the NCMS also held joint
		  meetings with the St Andrew's Mission about the Pleasance. All the NCMS's
		  activities were overseen by an Advisory Council of representatives of the
		  senate of New College, the Edinburgh Presbytery and other interested parties.
		  In 1900 the Society merged with a section of the United Presbyterian College
		  Missionary Society and was open to members of the United Free Church. When the
		  NCMS combined with the EUMA it became the Edinburgh University New College
		  Missionary Society until 1934 when it was decided to revert simply to the title
		  New College Missionary Society.</p> 
		<p>The United Presbyterian Students Missionary Society in connection with
		  Edinburgh University was formed with similar aims as the EUMA and NCMS, but was
		  for United Presbyterians only. </p>

		<p>The records include: the Edinburgh University Missionary Association
		  (minutes 1825-1929, minutes of the Home Mission 1889-1992, minutes of the
		  Christian Evidence Section 1887-1889; annual reports 1927-1914; lists of
		  members 1839-1931; newspaper cuttings 1877-1879; library catalogues and loan
		  books 1848-1891; correspondence 1826-early 1900s); the United Presbyterian
		  Students Missionary Society (minutes 1849-62); and the New College Missionary
		  Society (minutes, including Advisory Council minutes, 1908-1987, Settlement
		  Committee minutes 1890-1932, minutes of the joint committee of New College and
		  Free St Andrews Mission; and NCMS reports, pamphlets, correspondence and other
		  papers from 1908).</p> 
	 </scopecontent> 
	 <arrangement> 
		<p>The records form part of the collection of New College Archives (AA)
		  in the series New College and Edinburgh University Student Societies. The
		  records of each society or association are grouped together: EUMA from AA 3.3.1
		  to 3.3.34; UPSMS is at AA 3.3.35; and NCMS from 3.3.40 to 3.3.75. Gaps have
		  been left in the numbering where minute books are missing. Within each group
		  minutes, correspondence and reports are arranged in broadly chronological
		  order. Only one box, AA 3.3.32, contains material (correspondence) concerning
		  both the EUMA and the NCMS.</p> 
	 </arrangement> 
	 <custodhist> 
		<p>Earlier New College Missionary Society records once existed but no
		  longer form part of the collection. The first minute book surviving in the
		  collection is marked number 5.</p>

	 <acqinfo> 
		<p>The records were transferred from the NCMS to New College Library over
		  a period of time (details from 1971 are recorded in the New College accessions
