		<p>George Low was born in Edzell, Angus, in 1747. He was educated at
		  Marischal College, Aberdeen, and then at St. Andrews University. In 1768, Low
		  went to Stromness, Orkney, as a tutor. The rest of his life was taken up by the
		  study of the natural history of the Orkney Islands, looking at birds, flora and
		  fauna, and marine life there. As an aid to his studies of marine life, he
		  constructed a microscope. In 1771, Low became licensed as a Minister by the
		  Presbytery of Cairston, but he remained in Stromness for a couple more years
		  after that. In the meantime, in 1772, after a visit to Iceland, the explorer
		  and naturalist Sir Joseph Banks (1743-1820) visited Orkney in the company of
		  the Swedish botanist Dr. Daniel Solander (1736-1782), and physician Dr. James
		  Lind (1716-1794). Through them, Low was able to widen his correspondence and
		  connections, and in 1774 began a tour of the south islands of Orkney and the
		  whole of the Shetland Islands. Also in 1774, he was installed in the Parish of
		  Birsay and Harray, and as Minister there, in relative seclusion, he was able to
		  complete his works on the history and flora and fauna of Orkney. This was in
		  addition to earlier work on the commerce, population, language, and archaeology
		  of the islands. In 1778, Low toured the north islands of Orkney. Extensive use
		  of the microscope during his research probably contributed to the onset of
		  opthalmia and near complete blindness by 1793, thus cutting him off from his
		  studies. George Low died in Orkney on 13 March 1795.</p>
