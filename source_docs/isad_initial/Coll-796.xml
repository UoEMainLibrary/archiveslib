		<p>William Soutar was born on 28 April 1898. He was the son of John
		  Soutar, a Perth joiner and contractor. He was educated at the Southern District
		  School and at Perth Academy. From 1916 he served in the navy and was
		  demobilised in 1919. Soutar then went to Edinburgh University and graduated in
		  1923 and it was during this period that his poetry emerged, his first
		  collection being 
		<title>Gleanings by an undergraduate</title> (1923). Soutar 'invented'
		the 'whigmaleerie', a poetical 'whim, a fantastical notion'. He was crippled
		during his life with spondylitis and was bedridden by 1930. William Soutar died
		of tubercolosis in Perth on 15 October 1943.</p>
