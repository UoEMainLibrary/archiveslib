		<p>James Telfer was born in Southdean, Roxburgh, on 3 December 1800. As a
		  shepherd he gradually educated himself and became a country schoolmaster,
		  teaching in Castleton, Langholm, and then for some twenty-five years at a small
		  adventure school of his own at Suaghtrees in Liddesdale. He was an admirer of
		  the poet James Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd (1770-1835) whom he befriended. In
		  1824 he published a volume of poems entitled 
		<title>Border ballads and miscellaneous poems</title>. James Telfer died
		on 18 January 1862.</p>
