		<p>The Whig politician George Douglas Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll, was
		  born on 30 April 1823. He was educated privately. He succeeded his brother as
		  Marquis of Lorne in 1837 and succeeded the 7th Duke of Argyll, his father John
		  Douglas Edward Henry (1777-1847), in 1847. He was Lord Privy Seal, 1853-1855,
		  1859-1866, 1880-1881, Postmaster-General 1855-1858, and 1860, and Secretary of
		  State for India, 1868-1874. As Secretary of State he adopted a foreign policy
		  of friendship to neighbouring states, and a financial policy of
		  decentralisation. Between 1877-1880, he opposed Tory government policy in the
		  Eastern Question and in Afghanistan. He also opposed Home Rule. The 8th Duke
		  published works on science, religion, and politics, and he was in disagreement
		  with evolutional school in geology. His published work included 
		<title>Presbytery examined</title> (1848), 
		<title>Primeval man</title> (1869), 
		<title>The eastern question</title> (1879), 
		<title>Scotland as it was and as it is</title> (1887), 
		<title>Irish nationalism</title> (1893), 
		<title>What is science?</title> (1898). The 8th Duke of Argyll was made a
		Knight of the Thistle in 1856, and a Knight of the Garter in 1883. He was
		Chancellor of the University of St. Andrews, and a Trustee of the British
		Museum. The hereditary home of the Dukes of Argyll is Inveraray Castle,
		Argyllshire, and the Duke also resided at Argyll Lodge, Kensington, London.
		George Douglas Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll, died on 24 April 1900. He was
		succeeded by his son John Douglas Sutherland (1845-1914), 9th Duke of
		Argyll.</p>
