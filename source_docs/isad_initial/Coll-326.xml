		<p>Robert Hamilton may have been born in 1707. He was the son of Dr.
		  William Hamilton, formerly Professor of Divinity at Edinburgh University, then
		  Principal of the University. Hamilton was Minister of Cramond in the city, then
		  successively Minister of Lady Yester's Church, and the Old Greyfriar's. In
		  Spring 1754, he was appointed to the Chair of Divinity at Edinburgh University.
		  Hamilton was twice Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland,
		  and he was made Dean of the Thistle. At the age of seventy-two, he applied for
		  assistance in the work of his Chair and in 1779 Dr. Andrew Hunter became
		  joint-Professor of Divinity. Professor Robert Hamilton died on 2 April 1787.
