		<p>Benjamin Fonseca Outram was born in Yorkshire in 1774. He was educated
		  as a surgeon in London and was first employed in the naval medical service in
		  1794. He served on the 'Harpy', 'La Nymphe', and 'Boadicea'. During the
		  Napoleonic Wars and in a famous action off Cadiz when Sir James De Saumarez
		  (1757-1836) was victorious over the French and Spanish fleets on 12 July 1801,
		  Outram was surgeon on the vessel 'Superb'. For his services under Sir Richard
		  Goodwin Keats (1757-1834) during the hostilities, Outram was decorated. For
		  some years after this, he served as surgeon on the yacht 'Royal Sovereign'.
		  With the ambition of becoming a general practitioner, he went to Edinburgh
		  University in 1806 and he graduated with the degree of Doctor of Medicine on 24
		  June 1809. His thesis was entitled 
		<title>De Febre continua</title> (1809). Outram was licensed by the Royal
		College of Physicians of London in 1810 and he began to practice as a physician
		at Hanover Square, London, which would be his home for some forty years. In
		1838, he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of London and he was one
		of the first members of the Royal Geographical Society. In 1841, he became Her
		Majesty's Medical Inspector of Fleets and Hospitals, and was knighted in 1850.
		Sir Benjamin Fonseca Outram died in Brighton on 16 February 1856.</p>
