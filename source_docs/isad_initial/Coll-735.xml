		  Between 1880 and 1882 he was a Hebrew tutor at the Free Church College,
		  Aberdeen, then Minister of Queens' Cross Free Church, 1882-1892. Smith was
		  appointed to the Chair of Old Testament Language, Literature and Theology at
		  the United Free Church College, Glasgow, in 1892, and throughout the 1890s and
		  into the new century he lectured extensively in the USA. He was appointed
		  Principal and Vice-Chancellor of Aberdeen University in 1909, and held these
		  offices until 1935. His publications include
