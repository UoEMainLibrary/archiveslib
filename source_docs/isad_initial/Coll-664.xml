		<p>The novelist Annie Shepherd Swan was born at Mountskip, Gorebridge,
		  Midlothain, in 1859. She was educated at the Ladies' College in Edinburgh. Her
		  writing career began with stories for children and with contributions to 
		<title>The Christian leader</title>. Other work includes 
		<title>Ups and downs</title> (1878), 
		<title>Aldersyde</title> (1883) the romance which established her, 
		<title>Carlowrie</title> (1884), 
		<title>The gates of Eden</title> (1886), 
		<title>Across her path</title> (1889), 
		<title>Who shall serve</title> (1891) and 
		<title>A bitter debt</title> (1893). Her latter novels were influenced by
		Scottish industrial life. Swan's literary career advanced when she moved to
		London in the early-1890s. There she contributed to women's magazines and wrote
		light romances. Swan married James Burnett-Smith. She was given the CBE in
		1930. Latterly Annie Shepherd Swan (or Annie Burnett-Smith) lived at Gullane,
		East Lothian, and she died at Gorebridge, Midlothian, on 17 June 1943.</p>
