		<p>Dr. J. M. Kerr was a medical graduate, Edinburgh University, and he
		  had been a former pupil of George Watson's Boy's College, Edinburgh.</p> 
	 </bioghist> 
	 <scopecontent> 
		<p>The papers are composed of manuscript notes of a trip to Lucerne,
		  Switzerland, in a notebook, manuscript notes for 
		<title>En Italic Pepes</title> in two notebooks, and a bundle of papers,
		typescript 
		<title>Its Hooley Talking</title>. The latter is a novelette supposedly
		of the experiences of an Irish immigrant in Glasgow, and the Swiss trip is that
		made by a student, a working-class journey in Europe written at a time when
		most descriptions are of middle-class and upper-class journeys. </p>
