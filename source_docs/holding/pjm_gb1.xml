		<p> Percy Edwin Alan Johnson-Marshall (<date type="lifespan"
		  normal="1915/1993" certainty="certain">1915-1993</date>) was one of the most
		  energetic of a generation of town-planners who began their careers in the 
		  <date type="inclusive" normal="1930/1939"
			certainty="uncertain">1930s</date> and, after the Second World War, dedicated
		  their lives to the creation of a new world of social equity through the radical
		  transformation of the human environment. </p> 
		<p>Born in Ajmer, India, he was brought by his parents, via the Middle
		  East, to England in the

		  Johnson-Marshall to the School of Architecture at the University of Liverpool.
		  Here he studied under the two most eminent professors of the period, Sir
		  Charles Herbert Reilly and Sir Leslie Patrick Abercrombie. </p> 
		<p>After gaining the Diploma in Architecture (with distinction), in

		  Middlesex County Council, then for Willesden Borough Council (<date

			certainty="certain">1938</date> Coventry City Council created its new City
		  Architect's Department, appointing the highly respected Donald Evelyn Edward

		  Gibson and given the post of Senior Assistant Architect in charge of
		  redesigning the obsolete city-centre, in 
		  <date type="appointmantdate" normal="1939"
		  certainty="single">1939</date>. The design of the new civic centre was given

				<head>Administrative History</head> 
				<p> In England the tiered system of political representation
				  entails local authorities, which exercise a measure of devolved power from the
				  national government of the United Kingdom. The regional, or city, council is an
				  elected body of representatives controlling certain aspects of the
				  administration of local government. The council, or corporation, employs a body
				  of professional officials, essentially civil servants, both administrative and
				  technical, to undertake its work. A variety of departments, such as Parks or
				  Housing, with their own staff, are directed by committees of councillors, which
				  are specific to the remit of each department. Larger departments often require
				  sub-committees, although all the committees are technically sub-committees of
				  the Full Council and its vote. The committees and sub- committees of London
				  County Council generated a body of material including agendas for, and minutes
				  of, their meetings. The committees were informed by a variety of reports from
				  the London County Council's own officials, as well as from national
				  governmental bodies and independent professional bodies. </p>

				  <head>Administrative History</head> 
				  <p> The London County Council Town Planning Committee was a
					 sub-committee of the full Council, which convened to consider planning
					 applications under the regulations of the 
					 <bibref><title render="italic">Town &amp; Country Planning Act
						  </title> (<imprint><date type="publication" normal="1947"
						certainty="certain">1947</date>)</imprint></bibref>. In arriving at its
					 decisions, the Committee sought the recommendations of the Town Planning
					 Division of the Architect's Department which in turn gathered opinions from
					 Council officials in its various departments, such as Parks and Roads, as well
					 as from non-Council bodies and statutory undertakers such as the Thames Ports
					 Authority, the Metropolitan Police Service and London Transport. A number of
					 planning sub-committees existed to consider specific aspects of development
					 proposals, with specialist sub-committees to consider: (compliance with) the
					 Development Plan; Areas of High Fire Risk, Redevelopment and Road Improvements,
					 Architectural and Historic Buildings; London Bye Laws; Special Improvements and
					 Developments. Developments, on behalf of London County Council, by its own
					 Architect's Department, were also subject to this process. A decision by the
					 Town Planning Committee was equivalent to a recommendation for approval, or
					 rejection, by the Full Council. The Full Council often considered large or
					 important developments, in the first instance. </p>

				  <p>Although Percy Johnson-Marshall was most involved with the
					 Town Planning Committee, there were a number of other London County Council
					 Committees which he consulted the papers of. The Housing Committee formulated
					 the housing policies of London County Council and directed the work of
					 officials in its Housing Department. It had many sub-committees, including the
					 Development and Management Sub-Committee, which dealt with providing new
					 Council housing. This might be designed by the Architect's Department or by
					 private sector architect's, with work carried out either by London County
					 Council direct labour organisation or contracted out to construction firms.
					 There were also London County Council committees for Parks, Roads and
					 Education, which itself had sub-committees for Schools, School Planning, and
					 Further Education. </p>

				<head>Administrative History</head> 
				<p> The Architect's Department of London County Council was
				  responsible for the development of London according to its own statutory plan.
				  This entailed positive planning as well as controlling or vetting private
				  development. The Department was under the leadership of the Architect to London
				  County Council. Sir Robert Hogg Matthew was the first post-war Chief Architect
				  (<date type="appointmentspan" normal="1946/1953"
				  certainty="certain">1946-1953</date>), succeeded by Sir Leslie Martin (<date
				  type="appointmentspan" normal="1953/1956" certainty="certain">1953-1956</date>)
				  and then Hubert Bennet. It was the largest such local authority organisation in
				  Western Europe, with 3000 staff in 
				  <date type="single" normal="1956"
				  certainty="certain">1956</date>. </p> 
				<p>Its design staff undertook a variety of jobs for London County
				  Council departments, such as Housing, Parks, Schools and general civic
				  improvements. From 
				  <date type="inclusive" normal="1946/1949"
				  certainty="certain">1946-1949</date> the Architect's Department was made up of
				  four main divisions: The Housing Division, the Schools Division, the Planning
				  Division and the General Division. </p> 
				<p>The Housing Division was the largest and was itself served by a
				  Housing Engineers Division, Structural Division and Quantities Division. </p> 
				<p>The Schools Division was a smaller group, with much design work
				  contracted out to private architects. It had responsibility for maintenance,
				  however.</p> 
				<p>The Planning Division was arranged into four sub-groups:
				  Information and Research, the Development Plan Group, the Application Group and
				  the Reconstruction Areas Group. Percy Johnson-Marshall was put in charge of the
				  Reconstruction Areas Group when it was set up in 
				  <date type="single" normal="1949"
					certainty="certain">1949</date>. At this time the Planning Division was under
				  the directorship of Arthur Ling. In 
				  <date type="single" normal="1956" certainty="certain">1956</date>
				  these groups were amalgamated into one single Policy Group for North East,
				  North West and South London districts. Percy Johnson-Marshall was in charge of
				  the North East group until 
				  <date type="single" normal="1959"
					certainty="certain">1959</date>. </p> 
				<p>The General Division dealt with anything that was not Schools,
				  Planning or Housing.</p>

				  <p> The principles and guidelines for city development were
					 contained in various manuals and handbooks. London County Council Architect's
					 Department produced a number of manuals of its own, pertaining to planning,
					 building controls, traffic congestion and internal protocols. Meanwhile the
					 Ministry of Town and Country Planning produced important guidelines, such as
					 its Handbook, 
					 <bibref><title render="italic">The Redevelopment of Central
						  Areas </title> (<imprint><date type="publication" normal="1947"
						certainty="certain">1947</date>)</imprint></bibref> , which outlined the
					 correct sequence of survey and development and the rules of development, in
					 terms of daylighting control and plot ratio. Circulars were produced by Her
					 Majesty's Stationary Office relating to both the Town and Country Planning Act,
					 
					 <date type="publication" normal="1947"
					 certainty="certain">1947</date> and Town and Country Planning Act, 
					 <date type="publication" normal="1959"

					 Council's Architect's Department. </p>

				  <head>Administrative History</head> 
				  <p> The Reconstruction Areas Group (RAG) was part of the Town
					 Planning Division within the London County Council Architect's Department. This
					 was set up in 
					 <date type="single" normal="1949"
					 certainty="certain">1949</date> to deal with bomb-damaged areas using powers
					 created under the 
					 <bibref><title render="italic">Town and Country Planning
						  Act</title> (<imprint><date type="publication" normal="1944"
						certainty="certain">1944</date>)</imprint></bibref> . The designation of such
					 areas allowed London County Council to purchase property to facilitate
					 reconstruction, subject to the approval of the Minister for Reconstruction.</p>
				  
				  <p>In 
					 <date type="single" normal="1956"
					 certainty="certain">1956</date> the Town Planning Division was reorganised into
					 three divisions, North-West, North-East and South. Percy Johnson-Marshall was
					 put in charge of the North-East division, which included Stepney/Poplar and
					 Bunhill Fields, replacing the RAG. The Housing Division, consisting of
					 architects and technicians, was responsible for the design and construction of
					 a substantial number of the dwellings that were built by the Housing Department
					 of London County Council. It also had some input into the design and layout of
					 London County Council housing contracts undertaken by private architects.</p> 
				  <p>Development in London was carried out according to the
					 principles contained in the County of London Development Plan. Such statutory
					 development plans are subjected to constant review based on the progress of the
					 current plan. The Town Planning Division of the LCC Architect's Department was
					 required to provide statements on policy and progress to facilitate revision of
					 the County of London Development Plan. The 
					 <date type="publicationdate" normal="1943"
					  certainty="certain">1943</date> plan was revised in 
					 <date type="single" normal="1951"
					  certainty="certain">1951</date> and 
					 <date type="single" normal="1955"
					  certainty="certain">1955</date>.</p> 
				  <p>Public Inquiries played a role in the planning process, taking
					 place prior to national government decisions on the approval of development
					 plan reviews, the designation of Comprehensive Development Areas and
					 Reconstruction Areas, as well as in the event of appeals by developers against
					 decisions made by the local planning authority. In London the Architect's
					 Department was required to provide proofs of evidence for consideration by the
					 reporters to the public inquiries.</p> 
				  <p>Open Space Deficiency was one of the problems identified in
					 the County Of London Plan (<date type="publicationdate"
					 normal="1951" certainty="certain">1943</date>, 
					 <date type="publicationdate" normal="1951"
					 certainty="certain">1951</date> and 
					 <date type="publicationdate" normal="1955"
					 certainty="certain">1955</date>) and the Town Planning Division of London
					 County Council Architect's Department attempted to address this issue by
					 allocating open spaces at agreed standards, on a neighbourhood basis, in its
					 development schemes. In London residential areas this was 4 acres per 1000
					 persons.</p>

						colour at 1:2500 scale. This plan is based on the 1947 Ward Population Figures.
						The 2 other plans are entitled "Open space deficiency: maps 1 and 2". These are
						very similar. They cover central London in colour at 1:2500 scale and are based
						on the interim standard of 2.5 acres per 1000 people. All 3 plans show existing

				  <p> A set of 35 sociological reports written by Margaret Willis
					 for London County Council's Architect's Department. The reports are based on
					 primary research conducted through questionnaire and survey work and report on
					 a number of factors which would influence housing design and amenity provision.
					 There are different editions or drafts of some of the titles, and some include
					 original photographs or are typescript. Subjects cover a wide range of issues,
					 including: social surveys, high rise buildings, provision of laundries, and
					 play-areas, open spaces and heating, and architectural design. </p> 
				  <p>There is also some associated correspondence and paperwork

				  <p> 244 acres in the City of London were considered suitable for
					 Comprehensive Development, at Tower Hill, the Barbican and St Paul's Cathedral,
					 and were designated as Comprehensive Development Area no 1 by London County
					 Council.</p> 
				  <p>The Barbican was under the jurisdiction of the Corporation of
					 London. They commissioned Charles Henry Holden and Sir William Graham Holford
					 in 
					 <date type="appointmentdate" normal="1947"
					 certainty="certain">1947</date> as planning consultants for a reconstruction
					 plan intended for private development. A joint London County Council/
					 Corporation of London basic scheme, involving pedestrian/traffic segregation
					 was produced in 
					 <date type="single" normal="1949"
					 certainty="certain">1949</date> and revised in 
					 <date type="single" normal="1954"
					 certainty="certain">1954</date>. A proposed development by the New Barbican
					 Committee, an architects' consortium, was put forward in 
					 <date type="single" normal="1954"
					  certainty="certain">1954</date>, with Kadleigh, Horsburgh &amp; Whitfield, as
					 architects. This was rejected after a planning appeal. </p> 
				  <p>The Corporation of London commissioned its Golden Lane housing
					 development from Chamberlin, Powell &amp; Bon (although the site was actually
					 in Finsbury).</p> 
				  <p>The St Paul's precinct was proposed in the Holford and Holden
					 City of London Plan,<date type="single" normal="1947"
					 certainty="certain">1947</date>, but re-planned by Holford, in consultation
					 with the Ministry of Housing and the chairmen of London County Council and the
					 Corporation of London. This design included a forecourt to the Cathedral and a
					 commercial area with a decking system.</p> 
				  <p>The Tower of London Comprehensive Development Area was an area
					 of urban blight with much war damage. The scheme attempted to create a suitable
					 setting for the historic Tower. Partly in the City and partly in Stepney, this
					 was a collaboration between the Corporation of London and the London County
					 Council Planning Division North-East Group, under Percy Johnson-Marshall. The
					 London County Council team leader was Walter Bor. </p>

				  <p> Prior to bombing during World War II, the adjacent boroughs
					 of Stepney and Poplar, in London's East End, had suffered from urban blight in
					 the forms of overcrowding, obsolescent buildings and lack of open space. 2000
					 acres were designated as a Comprehensive Development Area no 2 by London County
					 Council. This was replanned as a series of eleven neighbourhoods in 
					 <date type="inclusive" normal="1948/1949"
					 certainty="certain">1948-1949</date>. Residential density was set at 136

				  <p> An area extensively bombed during World War II, the London
					 County Council Comprehensive Development Area no 5: Elephant and Castle
					 centered on a junction of the roads from Westminster and the Waterloo and
					 Blackfriars Bridges. The basic redevelopment design went through various
					 permutations before London County Council built the London College of Printing,
					 designed by the Schools Division of the Architect's Department. In 
					 <date type="single" normal="1951" certainty="certain">1951
						</date>Percy Johnson-Marshall and Arthur Ling proposed a multi-level
					 intersection and combining the two underground stations. A more modest scheme,
					 with a single level roundabout (<date type="single" normal="1954"

					 competitions, drafted by Gordon Logie, in 
					 <date type="single" normal="1960"

					 commercial development, to be undertaken by private developers, was won by Erno

					 area. It had a mixture of commercial, industrial and residential uses. It was
					 divided into three sections: the western part was to be developed by the the
					 Corporation of London, and included the Northampton College of Technology
					 extension, by the London County Council Architect's Department Schools Division
					 and the Golden Lane Housing Scheme in the Borough of Finsbury. The central
					 part, between Golden Lane and Whitecross Street, was sponsored by the Peabody
					 Trust. The eastern part, where many pre-war flats survived, was partially

			 <head>Administrative History</head> 
			 <p>The Association of Building Technicians was founded in 1919 as the
				Architects' and Surveyors' Assistants' Professional Union. In 1924 it became
				the Association of Architects, Surveyors and Technical Assistants (AASTA). It
				changed name again in 1942 to become the Association of Building Technicians
				(ABT).</p> 
			 <p>During his early working life Percy Johnson-Marshall was an active
				member of the Association. He held office on a number of central and regional
				committees. Work on these included overseeing the authorship of reports and
				representing students in professional disputes. He was also one of the
				organisers of the "Coventry of Tomorrow Exhibition" mounted by the Coventry
				Branch of the AASTA in 1940. During the course of his membership,
				Johnson-Marshall also collected a selection of published material produced by
				the association. </p>

				<p>The various committees and sub-committees of the Association of
				  Building Technicians wrote responses to major reports by other bodies, and
				  reports recommending best practice for the professions which the union
				  represented. As Chairman of the Architects' Professional Advisory Committee
				  (<date type="inclusive" normal="1946/1947"
				  certainty="certain">1946-1947</date>) and Secretary to the Planning Committee
				  (<date normal="1948/1950" type="inclusive"
				  certainty="certain">1948-1950</date>), Percy Johnson-Marshall was involved in
				  coordinating research and compilation of these reports. A number of manuscript

				<head>Scope and Content</head> 
				<p>The Association of Building Technicians: draft reports consists
				  of manuscript and typewritten draft reports along with accompanying research
				  material and correspondence. There are several drafts of most of the reports
				  along with editorial comments. Related research material include
				  press-cuttings, pamphlets and reports by other bodies. Associated
				  correspondence includes requests for information, reactions to the reports, and
				  correspondence with possible publishers. Very few final copies of the reports
				  have been retained. Only 2 reports appear to have been compiled by Percy
				  Johnson-Marshall:

				<date type="appointmentspan" normal="1938/1941"
				 certainty="certain">1938-1941</date>. During his employment the City Architect
				was Sir Donald Evelyn Edward Gibson. Gibson was an innovative architect and
				town planner who embraced a project planning comprehensive redevelopment of the
				civic centre. These plans became reality after the destruction of the city's
				historic centre during a World War II bombing raid on

				  November 1940</date> left the city centre destroyed. Gibson was also interested
				in social housing and undertook some of the earliest use of prefabricated
				housing and other innovative construction techniques.</p> 
			 <p>Johnson-Marshall was an enthusiastic and valued member of Gibson's
				team. He participated in the construction of the first model for the
				redevelopment of the Civic Centre during his spare time. He was also one of the
				organisers of the "Coventry of Tomorrow Exhibition" mounted by the Coventry
				Branch of the Association of Architects, Surveyors and Technical Assistants
				(AASTA) in

				which show cased Gibson's ideas. When Johnson-Marshall was called up for active
				service in World War II Gibson made appeals for him to be repatriated to rejoin
				his team.</p> 
			 <p>Johnson-Marshall's period of employment with Coventry City Council
				had a profound effect on his later career, introducing him to the reality of
				planning for reconstruction and comprehensive redevelopment. He later used
				materials he collected both during and after his employment as the basis of a
				chapter of his book addressing these topics,

			 <head>Administrative History</head> 
			 <p>The International Centre for Regional Planning and Development
				(ICRPD) was conceived at a joint symposium held in London in 
				<date type="single" normal="1953" certainty="certain">1953</date>,
				organised by the School of Planning and Research for Regional Development, the
				School of Planning Club and Community Development Projects Ltd. At the
				symposium it was agreed that a centre for research and education, which would
				provide an information service and a meeting place, was required to enable
				closer contacts between the professions concerned with regional planning and
				development. </p> 
			 <p>A preparatory Committee was elected, which went on to organise the
				International Conference on Regional Planning and Development held at Bedford
				College, London in 
				<date type="single" normal="1955" certainty="certain">1955</date>.
				At this conference the resolution was passed to investigate setting up such a
				centre. GE Janson-Smith from the United Kingdom was elected chair of the
				international Provisional Committee charged with the investigation. </p> 
			 <p>Percy Johnson-Marshall was elected one of the British members.
				This Committee, through a number of meetings, developed a constitution for the
				proposed centre, which was finally approved in 
				<date type="single" normal="195711" certainty="certain">November
				  1957</date>. An International Seminar, which studied the history and concepts
				of regional planning, was held in The Hague, by the Netherlands Universities
				Foundation for International Cooperation, on behalf of the ICRPD in 
				<date type="single" normal="195807" certainty="certain">July
				  1958</date>. At this conference practical goals and membership criteria of the
				ICRPD were established, the focus having moved from the establishment of a
				physical centre to a dispersed programme of professional support and
				international collaboration. The ICRPD would aim to: document and diffuse
				information, undertake research, hold meetings, educate, create a register of
				experts and consultants and undertake public relations.</p> 
			 <p> In 
				<date type="single" normal="1958" certainty="certain">1958</date>
				the ICRPD exhibited at the World Exhibition in Brussels.</p> 
			 <p>International relations began to sour when it became apparent that
				a lack of financial support from the United Kingdom government, amongst
				accusations of communist sympathies, meant that the centre of activities would
				likely be established in the Netherlands. At this stage the British Group of
				the ICRPD, chaired by Robert Joseph Gardner-Medwin became more active. It had
				its own General Council, on which Percy Johnson-Marshall sat, and arranged
				study days for its members. These included the titles "Economic forces leading
				to urban concentration" and Urbanisation in the tropics - its causes and
				methods of control".</p> 
			 <p>Plans for an ICRPD Conference in Rhodes in 
				<date normal="196304" certainty="certain" type="single">April
				  1963</date> were strongly contested by the British Group, leading to the
				resignation of the president Leo Brandt.</p>

			 <head>Administrative History</head> 
			 <p> Percy Johnson-Marshall and Associates was founded, in 
				<date type="single" normal="1962" certainty="certain">1962</date>,
				by Percy Johnson-Marshall as a Planning Consultancy, initially on the strength
				of his appointment as Planning Consultant to the University of Edinburgh for
				its Comprehensive Development Areas. The company was originally based in
				outbuildings at Johnson-Marshall's house, Bella Vista, Duddingston, Edinburgh.
				The company specialised in Urban Design and Regional Plans, with very few
				architectural designs before 
				<date type="single" normal="1980" certainty="certain">1980</date>.
				Regional plans were produced for Porto, Portugal (<date
				type="inclusive" normal="1973/1975">1973-1975</date>) and, in association with
				Sir Robert Hogg Matthew for Coleraine, Northern Ireland (<date type="inclusive"
				normal="1966/1968" certainty="certain">1966-1968</date>), and Islamabad (<date
				type="single" normal="1961" certainty="certain">1961</date>). Major
				redevelopment plans were also produced for Kilmarnock, Sunderland, Newcastle
				upon Tyne (<date type="inclusive" normal="1968/1971"
				certainty="certain">1968-1971</date>) and Salford (<date normal="1961/1967"
				type="inclusive" certainty="certain">1961-1967</date>). Between 
				<date type="single" normal="1980" certainty="certain">1980</date>
				and his retirement in 
				<date type="single" normal="1985" certainty="certain">1985</date>,
				Johnson-Marshall's input declined, as the company moved towards more
				conventional architectural work and urban improvements. During this time work
				began to appear under the name of <!--index this-->Johnson-Marshall, Mackie and
				Hare, and later Percy Johnson-Marshall &amp; Partners (PJMP), with <!--index this-->Bruce
				Hare as principal architect. </p>

				<p> A Comprehensive Development Area (CDA) was a designation under
				  the 
				  <bibref><title render="italic">Town and Country Planning
						Act</title> (<imprint><date type="publication" normal="1947"
					 certainty="certain">1947</date>)</imprint></bibref> . This allowed a local
				  authority to acquire property in the designated area, using powers of
				  compulsory purchase in order to replan and develop urban areas suffering from
				  war damage or urban blight. </p> 
				<p>Surveys and feasibility studies were required for a CDA to be
				  considered and approved by the relevant Government Minister. In Scotland, this
				  was the Secretary of State for Scotland. The University of Edinburgh had two
				  CDAs planned. Unusually these were instigated by the University, rather than
				  the local authority, and planned by Percy Johnson-Marshall &amp; Associates.
				  The University/Nicolson Street CDA (<date type="single"
				  normal="1962" certainty="certain">1962</date>) comprised a large area including
				  that already earmarked for University development. The latter was to be linked
				  to a new commercial zone and a residential area to the east and required
				  collaboration between the University, the Local Authority and private
				  developers. The scheme, however, stagnated and was never approved by the
				  Secretary of State, becoming officially defunct in 
				  <date type="single" normal="1975"
				  certainty="certain">1975</date>, with Local Government Reorganisation and the
				  publication of the South Side Local Plan, (formerly intended as the South Side
				  District Plan).</p> 
				<p>The Mound/Lawnmarket CDA was another proposal by
				  Johnson-Marshall that never achieved statutory status. This area consisted of
				  about 8 acres of densely built-up, and fairly ancient property in the Old Town
				  surrounding the headquarters of the University's Faculty of Divinity at New
				  College. The scheme started with the need for renovation of New College and the
				  dire state of some historic buildings adjacent to it (<date type="single"
				  normal="1961" certainty="certain">1961</date>). A CDA was proposed in 
				  <date type="single" normal="1967" certainty="certain">1967</date>
				  to enable expansion of the academic buildings and conversion of several old
				  tenements for student accommodation. However, the scheme was scaled down,
				  although Mylne's Court was successfully rehabilitated for residencies and New
				  College restored, by 
				  <date type="single" normal="1970"
				  certainty="certain">1970</date>. Ultimately, other properties were found to be
				  not viable for conversion and the CDA proposal was advanced no further. The
				  University operated from a variety of sites: the Central Area, including George
				  Square and Old College; King's Buildings, the location of the Faculties of
				  Science and Engineering; Pollock Halls, the student residences; The
				  Mound/Lawnmarket, including New College; High School Yards, where many historic
				  buildings were converted for University use, between 
				  <date type="inclusive" normal="1905/1965"
					certainty="certain">1905 and 1965</date>. There were also departments operating
				  from individual sites around the city. </p>

				  <p> The City of Edinburgh's elected representative body, from 
					 <date type="inclusive" normal="1900/1975"
					  certainty="certain">1900-1975</date> was the City of Edinburgh Corporation.
					 This was succeeded in 
					 <date type="single" normal="1975"
					  certainty="certain">1975</date> by Edinburgh District Council. In Scotland,
					 decisions are, for the most part, delegated to specialist committees, which
					 perform as sub-committees to the Full Council. This enables detailed
					 consideration of complicated matters, which the Full Council would not have
					 time to examine closely. Committee decisions have to be ratified by the Full
					 Council. In addition working parties, consisting of non-elected experts and
					 Council officials are frequently set up to report to the Council with advice on
					 important but complicated issues. One such working party, the City of Edinburgh
					 Working Party on Major Highway Planning (<date type="inclusive"
					 normal="1963/1983" certainty="certain">1963-1983</date>), gathered information
					 and formulated proposals concerning the city's, seemingly intractable roads
					 problems.</p> 
				  <p>The governing body of the University of Edinburgh is the
					 University Court. Sub-committees of the Court are created to take
					 responsibility for investigating and making recommendations to the Court on
					 time-consuming issues. The Development Committee, constituted in 
					 <date type="single" normal="1954"
					 certainty="certain">1954</date>, as successor to the Post-war Development
					 Committee, had responsibility for the physical development of the University.
					 The Works and Buildings Committee was constituted in 
					 <date type="single" normal="1965"
					 certainty="certain">1965</date>, as a successor to the Major Buildings
					 Committee, and had responsibility for individual building projects, dealing
					 directly with the architects and user-group sub-committees. </p>

						<date type="publication" normal="1949"
						certainty="certain">1949</date>, and its successors, recommended major highway
						improvements for Edinburgh. Plans were discussed and redrawn over a long
						period. The Working Party on Major Highway Planning was set up to consider the
						alternatives and advise the local authority on transport strategy. The Eastern
						Link Road, from St Leonard's to Calton Hill, was of particular interest to the
						University of Edinburgh as it occupied property affected by the Link and its
						feeder roads. Resolution of the Eastern Link Road issue was critical for the
						finalisation of the layout of the University/Nicolson Street Comprehensive
						Development Area. Percy Johnson-Marshall represented the University's interests
						as expert planner on the Working Party. One of Johnson-Marshall's own proposals
						was for a new carriageway through the Grassmarket for which he commissioned
						perspectives from Alexander Duncan Bell, in

						secretary, it had responsibility for the physical development of the
						University. Its job was to translate academic aspirations into plans for
						buildings, appointing architects, negotiating with the local authority and
						arranging funding with the University Grants Committee. The UDC itself spawned
						numerous sub-committees, from time to time, such as the Science Faculty
						Development Sub-committee and the Conservation Group Sub-committee and other
						site-specific and building user-groups. As Planning Consultant to the
						University, Percy Johnson-Marshall received his instructions from the
						Committee. He provided plans, models, reports and recommendations in respect of
						his responsibility for the Central Area. This included Bristo Square, George
						Square, Chambers Street, the Student Amenity Centre, the Medical School
						Extension, the proposed Dental Hospital, the proposed Physical Education
						building, Old College and Buccleuch Place; all under the auspices of the
						University/Nicolson Street Comprehensive Development Area (CDA) scheme. He was
						also responsible for the Mound/Lawnmarket CDA; incorporating Mylne's Court, as
						well as the King's Buildings site and Peffer Mill playing fields.</p>

						  <p>Mixed collection of working drawings and plans (maximum
							 dimension 86cm x 122cm) depicting the creation of Bristo Square in Edinburgh.
							 There is a 3-dimensional pencil drawing, on tracing paper, of an oblique bird's
							 eye view of the square and its adjacent buildings. 2 coloured (in thick
							 felt-tip pen) paper stylised manuscript plans of the area. The first shows the
							 proposed surface of the square, the second shows the site-lines around the area
							 of the square. There are 2 sheets of small-scale pencil drawn sections across
							 the square. These are on tracing paper, have felt-tip pen highlighting and
							 labels for the main features. There is a large scale pen and ink drawing, on
							 tracing paper with "letratone" to indicate surface detail. This was a working
							 drawing for the final item: a copy of a large scale architectural plan drawing,
							 on textured paper, of the whole square in the context of the surrounding
							 University buildings. </p>

					 <p>The University of Edinburgh's post-World War II development

						large central garden. Development had already commenced on the Medical School
						Extension (<date type="single" normal="1956" certainty="certain">1956</date>)
						and the Faculty of Arts phase one, according to the Sir Basil Urwin Spence
						layout of 
						<date type="single" normal="1955"
						certainty="certain">1955</date>, when Percy Johnson-Marshall was appointed
						Planning Consultant. Johnson-Marshall was not the architect of any of the
						George Square buildings but took responsibility for the overall layout,
						designation of sites, harmonisation of finishes, landscaping and external
						works. The second phase of the Arts Faculty Buildings (<date type="single"
						normal="1967" certainty="certain">1967</date>), the Main Library (<date

					 <head>Administrative History</head> 
					 <p>Chambers Street, Edinburgh, is dominated by the University
						of Edinburgh's 18th century Old College building and the Royal Scottish Museum,
						on its south side. The street was included in the University of
						Edinburgh/Nicolson Street Comprehensive Development Area on its northern
						boundary. Chambers Street, together with the adjacent George IV Bridge,
						featured in several feasibility studies in the 
						<date type="inclusive" normal="1970/1979"
						certainty="uncertain">1970s</date> as the government sought to extend both the
						Museum and the National Library of Scotland (NLS). The Ministry of Public
						Buildings and Works produced an unexecuted scheme to extend the Museum in 
						<date type="single" normal="1970"
						certainty="certain">1970</date>, with another drafted by the Department of the
						Environment, in 
						<date type="single" normal="1973"
						certainty="certain">1973</date>. A competition-winning design for the Museum
						extension, by Benson &amp; Forsyth, was finally completed in 
						<date type="single" normal="2000"
						certainty="certain">2000</date>. The removal of Heriot-Watt University to a new
						campus left its old Chambers Street building vacant. It was first considered
						for use by the University of Edinburgh and then by the NLS, with a feasibility
						study produced by the Department of the Environment and Plowman, Craven &amp;
						Associates (<date type="single" normal="1973" certainty="certain">1973</date>)
						before it was ultimately taken over by the Crown Office as its headquarters.
						The NLS extension was finally built behind the existing building (<date
						type="inclusive" normal="1999/2001" certainty="certain">1999-2001</date>).
						Since 
						<date type="single" normal="1926" certainty="certain">1926
						  </date>the University has occupied Minto House, which is flanked by the
						Heriot-Watt building and an entrance to the Argyll Brewery site. The University
						of Edinburgh acquired the brewery in 
						<date type="single" normal="1972"
						certainty="certain">1972</date> and Ian G Lindsay &amp; Partners undertook
						feasibility studies. In 
						<date type="single" normal="1975"
						certainty="certain">1975</date>, the Departments of Architecture, Urban Design
						&amp; Regional Planning and Landscape Architecture moved into premises
						comprising Minto House and the brewery maltings, which had been converted for
						the purpose by Ian G Lindsay &amp; Partners. Another part of the brewery site,
						in the Cowgate, was redeveloped for student accommodation in the 
						<date type="inclusive" normal="1990/1999"
						certainty="certain">1990s</date>, and the ancient Tailor's Hall sold to a

						  <p>Large scale black and white photographic prints (maximum
							 size 51cm x 60cm), which join together to show the full facade of the former
							 Heriot-Watt University building in Chambers Street in Edinburgh. The adjacent
							 Bank of Scotland, former dental hospital and Minto Street are also included.
							 The statue of James Watt, later removed to the new Heriot-Watt University
							 campus can be seen in situ as can busts of the founders of Heriot-Watt
							 University: George Heriot and Leonard Horner. Some of the photographs have
							 dimensions of parts of the buildings inked on, in metres, and a man holding a
							 surveying pole, for scale, appears in some. </p>

					 <p>The University of Edinburgh and the Royal Infirmary of

						Amenities, a Physical Education building and buildings for the Science Faculty
						(Appleton Tower extension). However the Empire Garage site, on Potterrow, was
						re-allocated for the Physical Education building and designs for the new Dental
						Hospital were produced by Morris &amp; Steedman (<date type="inclusive"

					 <head>Administrative History</head> 
					 <p>Buccleuch Place, Edinburgh, a street of Georgian Tenements,
						lies immediately to the south of George Square and therefore became part of the
						University of Edinburgh's various redevelopment schemes. Property was acquired
						there in the

						certainty="certain">1950s</date> and 
						<date type="inclusive" normal="1960/1969"
						certainty="certain">1960s</date> in anticipation of demolition - Percy
						Johnson-Marshall's Comprehensive Development Area (CDA) scheme envisaged the
						Arts Faculty buildings extending into Buccleuch Place during later phases of
						development. One block was demolished in 
						<date type="inclusive" normal="1959/1960"
						certainty="certain">1959-1960</date> to make way for the first phase of the
						Arts Faculty Buildings. Other properties were converted into temporary
						University accommodation or were used to house tenants displaced by other
						developments in the area. With the abandonment of the CDA plan (<date
						type="single" normal="1975" certainty="certain">1975</date>) and the statutory
						listing of the surviving buildings, Buccleuch Street remains largely in
						University use.</p>

						<p>Six reports, by three different consultants: Percy
						  Johnson-Marshall &amp; Associates, Robert Matthew, Johnson-Marshall and
						  Partners and the University of Edinburgh Architecture Research Unit. Five
						  concern feasibility studies for possible development of miscellaneous sites
						  within the University of Edinburgh Comprehensive Development Area. Locations
						  considered are the Appleton Tower in George Square, the High School Yards site,
						  the Buccleuch Church site, the Empire Theatre site and the Empire Garage site.
						  In addition there is a study concerning the long-term development of the
						  University which sets out an analysis of the University's medium to long-term
						  planning proposals.</p>

					 The South Side locality of Edinburgh, designated by the local authority in 
					 <date type="single" normal="1972"
					 certainty="certain">1972</date>, contained much of the land involved in the
					 University Comprehensive Development Area (CDA). This CDA scheme was stagnant

					 <date type="single" normal="1975"
					 certainty="certain">1975</date>.</p> 
				  <p>Percy Johnson-Marshall &amp; Associates were commissioned by

					 housing quality, residency and population, commercial uses and buildings of
					 architectural interest (<date type="inclusive" normal="1973/1975"
					 certainty="certain">1973-1975</date>). Johnson-Marshall was also required to

						<p>This file contains 9 reports concerning the Edinburgh
						  South Side District Plan written by either Percy Johnson-Marshall or staff at
						  Percy Johnson-Marshall &amp; Associates. The reports look at: the place of the
						  university in the city as a whole, the relationship between the University of
						  Edinburgh and the rest of the south side, land use surveys and possible
						  development plans for the Nicolson Street area of the city and a 1971 census
						  household analysis of the south side. A file of papers relating to the
						  methodology of the census analysis and original plans, diagrams and drawings
						  for the census reports are included. </p>

					  certainty="certain">1964</date>, coordinating developments, allocating sites
					 for buildings and determining the roads and general layout in a series of

					 Experimental Petrology, and Epigenetics. Many existing buildings were also
					 extended and Percy Johnson-Marshall &amp; Associates were the architects for
					 the system-build multi-storey car park.</p>

				  <p>The University of Edinburgh Mound / Lawnmarket Comprehensive
					 Development Area (CDA) involved a large block of historic structures in the
					 heart of Edinburgh's Old Town, including New College, Mylne's Court, James
					 Court, the Outlook Tower, Lister House, and Semple's Court. New College and
					 some residential properties, all badly in need of restoration, were transferred
					 from the Church of Scotland to the University in 
					 <date type="single" normal="1961"
					 certainty="certain">1961</date>. Ian G Lindsay &amp; Partners were then engaged
					 as architects for the restoration of New College and to produce a feasibility
					 study for the conversion of Mylne's Court for student accommodation. In 
					 <date type="single" normal="1964"
					  certainty="certain">1964</date> the University launched a Comprehensive
					 Development Area project with the intention of creating a complex of student
					 residences by purchasing and rehabilitating all the properties in the area.
					 Percy Johnson-Marshall was made planning consultant with John Reid, of Ian
					 Lindsay &amp; Partners, as specialist conservation architects and Hall &amp;
					 Sons as consulting engineers. </p> 
				  <p>Mylne's Court was successfully converted in two phases, Philip
					 Henman Hall and Edward Salveson Hall (<date type="inclusive" normal="1966/1970"
					 certainty="certain">1966-1970</date>). Other conversion projects within the CDA
					 - James Court, the Outlook Tower and Semple's Close - were abandoned for
					 economic reasons and the properties disposed of. With the exception of Lister
					 House, which was reconstructed and re-opened as Patrick Geddes Hall in 
					 <date type="single" normal="1978"
					  certainty="certain">1978</date>, named after Sir Patrick Geddes who worked from
					 the Outlook Tower during the 
					 <date type="inclusive" normal="1890/1899"
					  certainty="uncertain">1890s</date>.</p> 
				  <p>A scheme by architect John Reid, of Ian G Lindsay &amp;
					 Partners for an entirely new student hostel, together with a lecture room
					 extension for New College was abandoned, in 
					 <date type="single" normal="1970"

					 from site use surveys. The financial costs and forecasts had to be viewed in a
					 University-wide context, as well as a site-specific one. Development accounts
					 had to be carefully balanced, as most capital expenditure was funded by the

					 and University staff informed about development proposals, Percy
					 Johnson-Marshall organised a standing exhibition, "An Expanding University" at
					 Adam House, Chambers Street, which lasted from

					 and movement between, University sites, was explained by a continuing series of
					 published maps. </p>

					 <p>A selection of 7 published maps of the University of
						Edinburgh campus. There are 4 slightly different copies of a folding map
						published by Bartholomew Ltd and designed by Alexander Duncan Bell and John M
						MacGregor which shows the university buildings, important public buildings and
						the location of departments. 1 map forms part of a feature on the university's
						development plans, probably from a student newspaper, and shows university
						owned sites and buildings at George Square, New College, Old College and the
						King's Buildings. The final 2 plans are small scale location plans for the
						University buildings in the central area of Edinburgh.</p>

			 <head>Biographical History</head> 
			 <p>Percy Johnson-Marshall studied at the Liverpool School of
				Architecture at the University of Liverpool, where his brother Stirrat
				Johnson-Marshall was already a student, from 
				<date type="inclusive" normal="1931/1938"
				certainty="certain">1931-1938</date>. He initially completed a Diploma in
				Architecture and afterwards the Certificate in Civic Design. While a student
				Johnson-Marshall studied under a number of brilliant professorships. When he
				started his studies, the professor of architecture was Sir Charles Herbert
				Reilly who was followed by Lionel Bailey Budden in 
				<date type="appointmentdate" normal="1933"
				certainty="certain">1933</date>. Meanwhile Sir Leslie Patrick Abercrombie was
				the professor of civic design until 1935 and it is likely that Johnson-Marshall
				studied under him. Johnson-Marshall was a very able student, and during his
				time in Liverpool he won a number of awards, including the John Lewis
				Partnership Prize, 
				<date type="single" normal="1936" certainty="certain">1936</date>
				and the HW Williams Prize for the Promotion of Architectural Design in
				Concrete, also in 
				<date type="single" normal="1936" certainty="certain">1936</date>.
				His education at the University of Liverpool had a lasting influence over both
				his style and future career. After leaving the University, Percy
				Johnson-Marshall, along with other former students, instigated the formation of
				the Liverpool School of Architecture Society, a club for former students. After
				a successful inauguration dinner, this appears to have had a short life. </p>

			 <head>Administrative History</head> 
			 <p>The Service Arts and Technical Organization (SATO) was a voluntary
				organisation, which started life in Calcutta in 
				<date type="single" normal="1943" certainty="certain">1943</date>,
				during World War II, as the Service Architect's Organization (SAO). This group
				of British allied service men and women with architectural and planning
				backgrounds held technical meetings and produced a syllabus for a School of
				Indian Architecture and Regional Planning, in conjunction with Sris Chandra
				Chatterjee who had been campaigning for the formation of a school for twenty
				years. This was adopted as a faculty by the University of Calcutta. </p> 
			 <p>The group then went on to form the Service Arts Club, a forum for
				general arts discussion and education for servicemen and women in India. This
				met at Bengal Government School of Art. Groups formed in other Indian and
				Burmese cities under the umbrella of the Service Architect's Organization.
				These groups also had civilian members and held exhibitions, lectures,
				discussion groups, gave educational advice and undertook small architectural
				projects. They proposed a full education programme, part of which was
				supervising distance learning candidates in SE Asia for the London School of
				Planning and Research for Regional Development course in Town and Country
				Planning.</p> 
			 <p>Plans to develop cultural and educational centres at military
				bases were presented along with the new name - Service Arts and Technical
				Organization - in 
				<date type="single" normal="194501" certainty="certain">January
				  1945</date>. By this time the organisation was spread throughout SE Asia, with
				over twenty regional groups which established their own sections and societies
				in accordance with the artistic interests of their members. The following were
				the published aims;</p> 
			 <p>1. to build up a service organization of all those technically
				concerned with planning, building and engineering reconstruction, and to
				represent their views</p> 
			 <p>2. to develop and assist cultural and scientific planning
				activities</p> 
			 <p>3. to form clubs and groups and educational and cultural centres
				for the purpose of holding exhibitions, discussions, lectures etc, to keep
				libraries and to organise service "Technical Colleges"</p> 
			 <p>4. to assist in the education of students</p> 
			 <p>5. to assist services welfare and education and to give talks to
				Reconstruction and Planning Units to educate the public concerning
				possibilities and the use of experts</p> 
			 <p>6. to keep members in touch with current events, especially
				professional matters concerning technical personnel for reconstruction</p> 
			 <p>By 
				<date type="single" normal="194509" certainty="certain">September
				  1945</date>, under the leadership of the General Secretary, Percy
				Johnson-Marshall, the organisation moved away from general arts endeavours and
				cited its first priority as an information provider concerning "resettlement
				and reconstruction". With this in mind "propaganda" concerning this was made
				available, along with the establishment of a programme of technical education
				for troops. Attempts to give the organisation official educational status
				within the British Army were supported by the Royal Institute of British
				Architects (RIBA), the Association of Building Technicians (ABT) and the
				Association for Planning and Regional Reconstruction (APRR) who formed a Joint
				Committee and unsuccessfully approached the War Office.</p> 
			 <p>Regardless, Percy Johnson-Marshall set-up an experimental "tech"
				of 80 students, and coordinated education for the group. This included efforts
				to ensure that troops had access to distance learning courses whose exams were
				ratified by relevant professional bodies in Britain. SATO also addressed
				technical education for Indian and Burmese nationals and this was exemplified
				by the opening of the SATO Polytechnic in Rangoon on 
				<date type="single" normal="19451112" certainty="certain">12
				  November 1945</date>. </p> 
			 <p>Having finally been given official sanction the polytechnic
				operated both in-college and distance learning courses and provided access to
				text books, public lectures and touring exhibitions. </p> 
			 <p>Percy Johnson-Marshall ceased being the general secretary in 
				<date type="single" normal="194511" certainty="certain">November
				  1945</date> when he was repatriated. Shortly afterwards SATO ceased to exist
				with the gradual repatriation of the organisation's active members. </p>

				<p>While posted with the British Army in India, during World War
				  II, Percy Johnson-Marshall was General Secretary to the Service Arts and
				  Technical Organization (SATO) from 
				  <date normal="1943" type="appointmentdate"
					certainty="certain">1943</date> until his repatriation in 
				  <date type="appointmentdate" normal="1945"
					certainty="certain">1945</date>. While he was in post SATO achieved its aim of
				  setting up their own polytechnic to train army personnel in a variety of
				  technical skills. These included aspects of the building trade, to ensure that
				  returning British troops had the required skills to undertake employment in
				  post-war reconstruction. The polytechnic also enrolled army personnel who held
				  Indian or Burmese nationality to improve available skills for local
				  reconstruction. This was run by the 12th Army and based in Burma. Percy
				  Johnson-Marshall kept a number of files concerning the development and opening
				  of the polytechnic as well as the course which it offered. </p>

			 <p>After completing his Diploma in Architecture at the University of

				Willesden Borough Council from 
				<date type="appointmentspan" normal="1936/1938"
				certainty="certain">1936-1938</date>, where his brother Stirrat was already
				employed. He worked on municipal architectural projects as part of the team
				under the borough engineers F Wilkinson and his successor F Wayman Brown. These
				included school alterations, public housing estates, a refuse disposal plant
				and the electricity showroom on Willesden Lane. Johnson-Marshall also worked on
				the design for the Willesden Cemetery superintendent's house, and it is
				possible that he was the main architect for this.</p>

				<p>While employed by Willesden Borough Council, Percy
				  Johnson-Marshall collected copies of architectural plans for some of the
				  borough's public building projects. These are mostly attributed to the borough
				  engineer F Wilkinson and his successor F Wayman Brown, and include school
				  extensions, housing developments, an electricity showroom and a refuse plant.
				  Percy Johnson-Marshall worked on a number of these projects, and his initials
				  appear on a some of the plans.</p>

			 <head>Administrative History</head> 
			 <p>In 1935, the School of Planning and Research for National
				Development (SPRND) was set up as a postgraduate evening school within the
				Architectural Association (AA) School of Architecture. Here, graduates in
				architecture and other disciplines were able to take courses in planning and
				the diploma in town planning, ratified by the Town Planning Institute. </p> 
			 <p>The main instigator was Eric Alan Ambrose Rowse, then Assistant
				Director of the AA School, but shortly to become its Principal. When he
				resigned as Principal of the AA School in 
				<date type="single" normal="1938" certainty="certain">1938</date>,
				Rowse remained in charge of the SPRND. He took the School out from under the
				umbrella of the AA, in 
				<date type="single" normal="1940" certainty="certain">1940</date>,
				when it moved to its own premises in Gordon Square, London, setting up an
				advisory board of influential people with an interest in planning. The first
				board included Sir Raymond Unwin (chairman), Lord Horder (vice chairman),
				Francis Rowland Yerbury (secretary and treasurer) and Philip H Massey (editor
				of research). Staff included the architect, Justin E Vulliamy and sociologist
				Ruth Glass. The same year, before enlisting in the army, Rowse brought in
				Jaqueline Tyrwhitt as deputy. The name was changed to the School of Planning
				and Research for Regional Development (SPRRD) and, with War Office funding, a
				correspondence course in town planning for servicemen was set up. Government
				funding continued after the war, and completion courses were run for demobbed
				servicemen. </p> 
			 <p>The School had very close links to its sister organisation the
				Association for Planning and Regional Reconstruction (APRR), with the School of
				Planning using its library. With Rowse back as Principal in 
				<date type="single" normal="1947" certainty="certain">1947</date>,
				the emphasis was on team-work for training in regional planning. However, after
				the 
				<date type="single" normal="1951" certainty="certain">1951</date>
				Royal Institute of British Architects Schuster Committee Report on the training
				of architects and planners, government funding was withdrawn and, despite
				protests from a variety of influential quarters, the School closed in 
				<date type="single" normal="1954" certainty="certain">1954</date>.
				</p> 
			 <p>Percy Johnson-Marshall took the School of Planning and Research
				for Regional Development (SPRRD) intensive completion course, between in 
				<date type="single" normal="1946">1946</date>, in order to gain his
				Diploma in Town Planning. A School of Planning Club, with Percy
				Johnson-Marshall as Secretary, was in operation between

			 <p>Despite protests to the War Office by Coventry City Architect,
				Donald Gibson, Percy Johnson-Marshall was drafted, for active service in World
				War II, in 
				<date type="appointmentdate" normal="1941"
				certainty="certain">1941</date>. After basic training in England, during which
				time he gave lectures on planning to comrades, he was assigned to the Royal
				Engineers and posted to India, in 
				<date type="appointmentdate" normal="1942"
				certainty="certain">1942</date>, with a commission as Captain, later promoted
				to Major. </p> 
			 <p>In India, Johnson-Marshall became General Secretary of the Service
				Architects' Organisation (SAO), later renamed the Service Arts and Technical
				Organization (SATO), and was extremely active promoting the cause of city and
				regional planning and reconstruction. This was done through a series of
				lectures to servicemen and Indian organisations, such as the Indian Institute
				of Engineers (Bengal) as well as articles for journals, such as the Journal of
				the Indian Institute of Architects, and radio broadcasts for All-India Radio,
				in Calcutta. In addition, as a response to the lack of training for effective
				reconstruction, he prepared a memorandum for the Viceroy's Executive Council,

					 design and technics for India</title> (<imprint><date

				was included in a private press booklet 
				<bibref><title render="italic">Introduction to Planning</title>
				  (<imprint><date type="publication" normal="1944"
				  certainty="certain">1944</date></imprint>)</bibref>. </p> 
			 <p>Following the cessation of hostilities, Johnson-Marshall and
				William Tatton-Brown were seconded to the Government of Burma as advisors on
				planning and reconstruction. They submitted in three reports as 
				<bibref><title render="italic">A National Plan for Burma</title>
				  (<imprint><date type="publication" normal="1946"
				  certainty="certain">1946</date></imprint>)</bibref>. This was also outlined in
				an All-India Radio broadcast "The Burma Scene" (<date

				Journal (<date type="publication" normal="May 1946">May 1946</date>).</p>
