		  <p>Sir James Alfred Ewing (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1855/1935">1855-1935</date>), principal of the University of Edinburgh
			 from 
			 <date type="1916" normal="appointmentdate">1916</date>, was born in
			 Dundee, his father a minister in the Free Church of Scotland. As a child, he
			 would frequently carry out "experiments" that led to "fearsome explosions" in
			 his attic and the intentional administration of electric shocks. He attended
			 West End Academy and Dundee High School, before going to study engineering at
			 the University of Edinburgh, William Thomson, Baron Kelvin (<date
			 type="life-span" normal="1824/1907">1824-1907</date>) and PG Tait (<date
			 type="life-span" normal="1831/1901">1831-1901</date>) among his teachers.</p> 
		  <p>During the long summer vacations of his university years, he
			 assisted in the laying cables for the Great Western Telegraph Co during its
			 wire laying expeditions, including one to Brazil. These expeditions were led by
			 William Thomson and HC Fleeming Jenkin (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1833/1885">1833-1885</date>), both of whom would have a significant
			 impact on his life. It was on Jenkin's recommendation that Ewing was appointed
			 Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Physics at the Imperial University of
			 Tokyo, Japan, in 
			 <date type="chairdate" normal="1878">1878</date>. After five years in
			 the far East, Ewing returned to Scotland to take up the post of Professor of
			 Engineering at University College Dundee (now the University of Dundee). In 
			 <date type="chairdate" normal="1890">1890</date>, he was appointed
			 Professor of Mechanism and Applied Mechanics at the University of Cambridge. He
			 became Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Edinburgh in 
			 <date type="appointmentdate" normal="1916">1916</date>.</p> 
		  <p>Early in his career, while in Japan, Ewing studied the frequent
			 earthquakes that occurred there, and invented instruments that were able to
			 measure seismic activity. However, the bulk of his important work was carried
			 out later in his life, when he was professor at Cambridge and finally Principal
			 at Edinburgh. At Cambridge, he transformed his department into, effectively, a
			 department of engineering, and increased its size. Ewing was, in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1890">1890</date>, asked by the Admiralty
			 to establish a training program for officers in the navy, which contained a
			 considerable element of engineering education. Ewing was also responsible for
			 the report into the effectiveness of a proposed steam turbine power station at
			 Cambridge. His favourable report led indirectly to the turbine's introduction
			 as a mode of propulsion for navy ships. His most famous contribution to
			 society, however, took place during the First World War, when he was placed at
			 the head of 'Room 40', the British codebreaking operation. Messages decoded by
			 his organisation led to the battles of Jutland and Dogger Bank. They also
			 decoded the 'Zimmermann telegram', sent by the German foreign minister to his
			 minister in Mexico, which made the United States join the war. The telegram had
			 outlined a policy of encouraging Mexico to join the war in Europe, in return
			 for German assistance in a planned invasion of the United States. Ewing
			 resigned his position in 'Room 40' in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1917">1917</date>, because he found it
			 impossible to carry out this job and that of Principal at Edinburgh at the same
			 time.</p> 
		  <p>In his tenure as Principal at Edinburgh, Ewing made numerous changes
			 to the University, notably the establishment of a new science campus at King's
			 Buildings, which allowed science and engineering, which had, to that date, been
			 fairly weak at Edinburgh, to expand and evolve. This expansion was aided by his
			 creation of several new chairs in the Faculty of Science and Engineering.</p> 
		  <p>Ewing's main contributions to science were the discovery of
			 hysteresis and the investigation of metals that have been streched. He
			 discovered 'slip-bands', microscopic disruptions in the crystalline makeup of
			 iron that has been streched beyond its elastic limit.</p>
