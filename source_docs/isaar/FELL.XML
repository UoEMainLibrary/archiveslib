		  <p>Honor Fell's contribution to science was in the development of the
			 'organ culture method'. This enabled scientists to grow living diffentiated
			 cells, largely obtained from the embryos of warm blooded animals, to create
			 cultures that mimic the behaviour of organs in the animal body. She inherited
			 her interest in animals and biology from her father and as a child, and whilst
			 at school, she kept ferrets. Her final years at school were spent at Madras
			 College, St. Andrews from where she went to Edinburgh University in 
			 <date normal="1918" type="single">1918</date>. In 
			 <date normal="1922" type="single">1922</date> she graduated in
			 Zoology.</p> 
		  <p>At the time, the Director at the Institute of Animal Breeding at
			 Edinburgh was Professor Francis Crew who sent her to Dr. Strangeways at
			 Cambridge to acquire the new technique of tissue culture. Crew describes how
			 her extraordinary talents were recognised, and in 
			 <date normal="1923" type="single">1923</date> she was offered a place
			 at the Strangeways Laboratory. Whilst working there she obtained her PhD in
			 (<date normal="1924" type="single">1924</date>) and later her DSc in (<date
			 normal="1932" type="single">1932</date>) from the University of Cambridge. The
			 development of specific cell groups or organ cultures enabled the exploration
			 of the life, characteristics and reactions of cells to beneficial and adverse
			 substances without the risks involved in exposing the cells of living human
			 organs.</p> 
		  <p>Fell specialised in the cells of bone and cartilage. Her most
			 significant work was in the role of the immune system in causing rheumatoid
			 arthritis. Her second contribution to science was the direction, with Dr F.G.
			 Spears, of the Strangeways Laboratory. Originally this was a small laboratory
			 founded next to the Cambridge Research Hospital for investigating the pathology
			 of rheumatoid arthritis and linked diseases. Honor became director in 
			 <date normal="1927" type="single">1927</date>. The laboratory's
			 survival was partly due to her skilful financial management of research grants
			 from the Medical Research Council and donors. In the 
			 <date normal="1930/1939" type="single">1930s</date> the Laboratory
			 pioneered the development of radiobiology - the effects of X-rays on living
			 animal tissue. This was a direct result of Honor's offer of study facilities to
			 scientists who were refugees of the 2nd World War. </p> 
		  <p>Despite limited resources the laboratory expanded, particularly with
			 the construction in 
			 <date normal="1938" type="single">1938</date> of a new wing funded by
			 the Rockerfeller Foundation. By 
			 <date normal="1970" type="single">1970</date> the Laboratory
			 possessed an international reputation and comprised 62 scientists and 29
			 technicians from all over the world. In retirement, in the role of a research
			 worker at the Department of Immunology at Cambridge University Department of
			 Pathology, she once again took up the immunobiology of rheumatoid disease. She
			 returned to Strangeways in 
			 <date normal="1976" type="single">1976</date> and remained there,
			 still working in the laboratory, until within four weeks of her death in 
			 <date normal="1986" type="deathdate">1986</date>.</p>
