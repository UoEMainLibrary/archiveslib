		  <p>Axel Fredrik Cronstedt (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1722/1765">1722-1765</date>) was a mining expert with the Bureau of
			 Mines, a chemist and a metallurgist, who is remembered for his discovery of
			 nickel in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1751">1751</date>. His father was an
			 officer in the Swedish military, and Cronstedt was expected to follow his
			 father's career. However, apart from a short spell during wartime, he did not
			 serve in the army. He studied maths at Uppsala and eventually became a
			 prominent expert in mining.</p> 
		  <p>To give himself more of a grounding in scientific methods, he
			 enrolled in a course entitled "The Art of Experiment and Chemistry," given by
			 Georg Brandt (<date normal="1694/1768" type="life-span">1694-1768</date>), the
			 discoverer of cobalt. Cronstedt, in his study of metals, was the first to
			 systematically use blowpipe analysis (where a small sample is burned in an
			 intense flame and the colours produced are analysed to determine the sample's
			 makeup). While he did not invent this method, it was Cronstedt who developed it
			 as a useful scientific tool, and it remained in wide use until the introduction
			 of the diffraction grating.</p> 
		  <p>The discovery of nickel was only proved beyond all doubt by Bergman
			 in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1775">1775</date> - after his death - but
			 Cronstedt was the first to identify 'kupfernickel' ("the devil's copper", as
			 miners of the day called it) as metal in its own right, rather than a
			 combination of copper, arsenic and other metals, as was generally believed by
			 his contemporaries.</p> 
		  <p>Cronstedt also introduced a new classification of metals, based on
			 their chemical structures rather than just their appearances. </p>
