		  <p>Sir Isaac Bayley Balfour (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1853/1922">1853-1922</date>) lived very much in the footsteps of his
			 father, John Hutton Balfour (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1808/1884">1808-1884</date>), who, like him, was a botanist of some
			 repute. Isaac Bayley Balfour was educated at the Edinburgh Academy, where,
			 despite a promising start, he made very little impression as a pupil. This was
			 because his interests and abilities were in the biological sciences, which were
			 taught to him by his father, rather than the classics that were taught at
			 school. Because of his father's post as Professor of Botany, the young Balfour
			 was able to visit the Edinburgh Botanical Gardens, not open to the public at
			 the time. This ready access to botany appears to have shaped Balfour's career.
			 Balfour studied at the University of Edinburgh, from which he graduated with
			 first class honours in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1873">1873</date>, and at the
			 universities in W&#x00C3;&#x00BC;rzburg and Strassburg (Strasbourg).</p> 
		  <p>Another formative experience in Balfour's life was his participation
			 in the astronomical expedition of 
			 <date type="single" normal="1874">1874</date> to Rodriguez. Though
			 the stated aim of the mission was to observe Venus, Balfour used the
			 opportunity to investigate the local flora, and on his return, the fieldwork he
			 had carried out permitted him to gain his doctorate. When, in 
			 <date type="aingle" normal="1879">1879</date>, his father resigned
			 the chair at Edinburgh, Glasgow professor Alexander Dickson (<date
			 type="life-span" normal="1836/1887">1836-1887</date>) was appointed in his
			 place, and the younger Balfour was promoted to the chair of botany in Glasgow.
			 In 
			 <date type="chairdate" normal="1884">1884</date>, he was appointed
			 Sherardian Professor of Botany at the University of Cambridge. It was, however,
			 after his return to Edinburgh to take up his father's old chair that Balfour
			 left his mark. His father had greatly enlarged the botanical gardens during his
			 tenure, but Balfour completely transformed them. Having put their finances on a
			 safer footing by transferring them to the crown, Balfour engaged himself in a
			 major reform of the gardens, establishing a proper botanical institute, and
			 largely redeveloping the layout of the gardens in order to have a proper
			 arboretum, building new laboratories and improving scientific facilities.</p> 
		  <p>Much of Balfour's research centred on his major interest of China
			 and the Himalayas, and he was particularly knowledgeable about Rhododendrons
			 and Primulas. However, his real skill was in organisation, and he thoroughly
			 changed for the better the study of botany in the three departments he
			 chaired.</p> 
		  <p>Balfour produced a number of papers during his career, but he did
			 not publish any books.</p>
