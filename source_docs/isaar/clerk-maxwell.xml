		  <p>James Clerk Maxwell (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1831/1879">1831-1879</date>), one of the finest scientific minds in
			 history, was mocked at school for his perceived stupidity. Though he had shown
			 scientfic curiosity from a very young age, Maxwell's intelligence was not
			 immediately obvious to his more literary-minded peers at the Edinburgh Academy,
			 partly because of his interest in science, which they did not understand, and
			 partly because of his reluctance to socialise with them. Whatever the reasons,
			 he only slowly emerged from this isolation when his school marks began to show
			 his exceptional talents. He went on to study at the universities in Edinburgh
			 and Cambridge.</p> 
		  <p>Maxwell wrote his first paper (which was delivered on his behalf, to
			 the Royal Society of Edinburgh), on the subject of ovals, when he was just
			 fourteen, and though most of its contents had already been explained by
			 Ren&#x00E9; Descartes (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1595/1650">1595-1650</date>), centuries earlier, it was a remarkable
			 achievement for a fourteen-year-old. In his lifetime, Maxwell wrote another
			 hundred and twenty-eight papers, on diverse subjects such as electromagnetism,
			 the kinetic theory of gases, astrophysics, optics and the theory of colours,
			 among others. It is, however, for his work in four key areas that he is famous:
			 electromagnetism, astrophysics, comparative colourimetry and rarified gas
			 dynamics. In electromagnetism, he described magnetic and electric effects as
			 (undefined) changes in the ether and made the link between electricity,
			 magnetism and light. In astrophysics, he won the Adams prize for his proof that
			 the rings of Saturn are made of numerous small solid particles, rather than
			 solid rings (to be stable, these would have to have their mass so concentrated
			 in one area to make it visible as a satellite from Earth) or liquid. The study
			 of rarified gas dynamics, which he invented, was another field in which he
			 distinguished himself - he explained in terms of gas dynamics the motion of
			 William Crookes' (<date type="life-span" normal="1832/1919">1832-1919</date>)
			 'radiometer', which had been taken as evidence that light could exert pressure,
			 which would have confirmed the particle theory of radiation. Maxwell proved
			 that the motion could be attributed to the effects of the rarified gas that
			 remained within the near-vacuum that the radiometer resided in. Finally,
			 Maxwell conducted a series of experiments on colour, in which he found out that
			 any colour could be created by adding or subtracting any other three colours,
			 and made a number of experiments to determine to what extent experience of
			 colour is subjective.</p> 
		  <p>Maxwell held the chair of natural philosophy at Marischal College,
			 Aberdeen from 
			 <date type="chairdate" normal="1856">1856</date> until he lost it in
			 the amalgamation of Aberdeen's colleges into the University of Aberdeen in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1860">1860</date>. In the same year, he
			 was appointed professor at King's College, London, where much of his important
			 work was carried out. He retired in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1865">1865</date>, to live at his home in
			 Glenlair, until he was persuaded, in 
			 <date type="chairdate" normal="1871">1871</date>, to become professor
			 of experimental physics at the University of Cambridge. In this position, he
			 founded the Cavendish Laboratory and supervised its construction. He occupied
			 the chair at Cambridge until his untimely death at the age of 48.</p>
