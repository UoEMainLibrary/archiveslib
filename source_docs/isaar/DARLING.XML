		  <p>Frank Fraser Darling's contribution to ecology and nature
			 conservation was in his development of ecological survey - the analysis of the
			 interdependent relationship between man, his native landscape and the wildlife
			 of his locality. He was born in the stable loft of a farm in Chesterfield. His
			 mother refused to give him into care. He was unconventional and ambitious and
			 much of this can be attributed to his mother's determination to overcome, what
			 in those days was, the crippling social disadvantage of illegitimacy. His
			 earliest experiences of nature were in dawn walks with is mother in the 'great
			 wood' near their home. He left school at fifteen and worked on a farm before
			 studying at the Midland Agricultural College. Here he heard about the work of
			 the Institute of Animal Genetics at Edinburgh University, and in the early 
			 <date normal="1930/1939" certainty="uncertain"
			  type="inclusive">1930s</date> the Director, Francis Crew (<date
			 normal="1886/1973" type="life-span">1886-1973</date>) offered him a place there
			 to study for a PhD. </p> 
		  <p>Fraser Darling's work on Blackface sheep introduced him to the
			 Scottish landscape, and shortly afterwards he combined this with his genetical
			 knowledge in a series of pioneering studies of the relationship between red
			 deer and the highlander, and the impact of the introduction of sheep in the 
			 <date certainty="uncertain" normal="1800/1899" type="inclusive">19th
				century</date>. He also studied the behavioural patterns of grey seals and
			 sea-birds. In the 
			 <date normal="1940/1949" type="inclusive">1940s</date> he took up
			 farming again, and his books on island life mark a shift towards what was to
			 become field survey - the human habitat, or 'human ecology' as he called it.
			 These studies integrated the disciplines of zoology and genetics with those of
			 natural history and conservation, and brought him to the attention of the
			 natural historian Sir Julian Huxley (<date normal="1887/1975"
			 type="life-span">1887-1975</date>). Darling's work influenced Tom Johnston
			 (<date normal="1881/1965" type="life-span">1881-1965</date>) who, as Secretary
			 of State for Scotland at the end of World War II, undertook to develop the
			 Highlands. Darling became the leading figure in Johnston's crofting improvement
			 programme, but the independent and unorthodox opinions he expressed in Natural
			 History of the Highlands and Islands (<date normal="1947"
			 type="single">1947</date>) and West Highland Survey (<date normal="1955"
			 type="single">1955</date>) curtailed his hopes of a senior government
			 appointment. Despite this he had become a popular national figure to the Scots,
			 and his scientific reputation was extremely high. He was offered a senior
			 lectureship in the Zoology Department at Edinburgh University, and became
			 Huxley's representative at the 
			 <date normal="1949" type="single">1949</date> UNESCO conservation
			 conference. </p> 
		  <p>In his early fifties, in his own words, he became a cosmopolitan.
			 The US government invited him to apply his principles of 'human ecology', and
			 his travels in America and Mexico resulted in Pelican in the Wilderness:
			 Odyssey of a Naturalist (<date normal="1956" type="publication">1956</date>).
			 This book highlighted a theme that had emerged in his Scottish studies - the
			 abuse of nature by man. Thus Darling's interpretation of the term ecology
			 became its defining characteristic in the 
			 <date normal="1960/1999" type="inclusive" certainty="uncertain">late
				20th century</date>. He repeated the methodology of his Scottish studies of red
			 deer in his 
			 <date normal="1952" type="single">1952</date> study of the impact of
			 the introduction of Siberian reindeer on native caribou and the consequences of
			 this for the Eskimo population. In the 
			 <date normal="1950/1959" certainty="uncertain"
			 type="inclusive">1950s</date> he undertook a series of 'ecological
			 reconnaissances' in Africa: as a result of which he 'dominated the field of
			 African ecology'. The diminution of wildlife in the game reserves and the need
			 for management policies on ecological principles was extremely pressing. </p> 
		  <p>From 
			 <date normal="1956/1961" certainty="uncertain"
			 type="inclusive">1956-1961</date> he toured Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and The
			 Sudan. He travelled on foot, by Land Rover and by air in the wet and dry
			 seasons. His holistic overview of complex ecosystems was augmented by the
			 advice of experts in the field. His conclusions encompassed issues as diverse
			 as tribal law, game management, game hunting - which he condemned as vandalism,
			 animal husbandry, flora and colonial politics. The novelty and enduring
			 significance of Fraser Darling's work arose from the union of his intuition
			 with the discipline of rigorous scientific investigation. He warned against
			 superficial and simplistic interpretations, and intensely disliked the
			 'specialists' who saw their role as information-providers for politicians. To
			 Darling science's purpose was to discover the principles that underlie the
			 complexity of nature in its widest sense.</p>

		  <p>He collaborated with William Orr, J.H. Ashworth and Cytovich on
			 genetics, with A.S. Leopold, John Morton Boyd and John Markham on the natural

			 issues in the USA.</p>
