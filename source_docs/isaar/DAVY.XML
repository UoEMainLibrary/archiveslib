		  <p>Sir Humphry Davy (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1778/1829">1778-1829</date>) is primarily remembered for his invention
			 of the miner's safety lamp. However, his main body of work was carried out in
			 his role as a chemist. He was also involved in the field of medicine in the
			 early years of his career.</p> 
		  <p>Davy showed signs of brilliance from a young age. As a child, he is
			 known to have developed the interest in the world that persisted for his entire
			 life. He considered becoming a poet, though he abandoned his literature for
			 science aged 19. In his early 20s, Davy became friends with Davies Giddy, later
			 Gilbert (<date normal="1767/1839" type="life-span">1767-1839</date>), who was
			 to become president of the Royal Society. Davy was able to use Giddy's
			 laboratory to carry out experiments on nitrous oxide (laughing gas) - which he
			 inhaled in order to test the theory that it was the "principle of contagion".
			 On Gilbert's recommendation, Davy was appointed to the Medical Pneumatic
			 Institution in order to continue his experiments into the medical uses of
			 various gases. He nearly died during one experiment while inhaling carburetted
			 hydrogen gas.</p> 
		  <p>His discoveries relating to the chemical effects of electricity won
			 him an invitation to France from Napoleon Bonaparte (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1769/1821">1769-1821</date>), to be presented with the emperor's prize
			 at the Institut de France in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1806">1806</date>, despite the state of
			 war that existed between Britain and France at the time. During this trip to
			 the continent, Davy investigated iodine (and its similarity to chlorine) and
			 proved that diamond is a form of carbon. His investigations into electrolysis
			 led directly to his discovery, a year later, of sodium and potassium, which he
			 electrolysed from soda and potash. With other techniques, he also isolated a
			 number of other metals for the first time.</p> 
		  <p>In other work, Davy proved that chlorine was an element (many
			 considered it to be a compound containing oxygen), and disproved therefore the
			 oxygen theory of acids. He (correctly) suggested that all acids contain
			 hydrogen. Davy also invented a form of sacrificial protection for the navy's
			 copper ships that was eventually dropped, because it worked too well: the
			 copper remained free of oxidisation, allowing for the vessels' hulls to be be
			 colonised by shellfish.</p> 
		  <p>Davy's safety lamp for miners is the invention or discovery that is
			 most associated with his name. He had been asked to investigate "fire-damp"
			 (methane gas) explosions in coal mines, caused by the candles miners used as
			 lighting. Davy's solution to the problem was both simple and elegant: he
			 surrounded the flame of the candle with wire gauze, allowing the light to get
			 out, and, crucially, allowing the gas that entered the lamp to explode without
			 the explosion spreading outside the lamp: the lamp cooled the explosion down by
			 dissipating the heat into the gauze, reducing the temperature to below the
			 level at which the surrounding gas could explode. This invention, which Davy
			 never patented, saved many miners' lives.</p>
