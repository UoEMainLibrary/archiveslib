		  <p>Clement Richard Attlee (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1883/1967">1883-1967</date>), Labour prime minister of Britain from 
			 <date type="appointmentspan" normal="1945/1951">1945-1951</date>,
			 presided over one of the most radical peacetime administrations in Britain's
			 history. Born into a prosperous family (his father was a solicitor), Attlee
			 went to private schools then to University College, Oxford, from which he
			 graduated with a second-class degree. The turning point in his life came when
			 he visited a boys' club in London's East End, which was supported by his old
			 school. The squalor he saw converted him from a conservative into a socialist.
			 In 
			 <date type="single" normal="1907">1907</date>, he became the manager
			 of the club and settled in the area. In 
			 <date type="single" normal="1908">1908</date>, he joined the
			 Independent Labour Party (ILP), a precursor of the modern Labour Party, and
			 soon after became a lecturer in social administration at Sidney Webb's London
			 School of Economics (LSE).</p> 
		  <p> Unlike many of his contemporaries in the Labour movement, Attlee
			 was not a pacifist, and he fought in the Middle East and in France (where he
			 was wounded) in World War 1. His breakthrough in politics occurred shortly
			 after the end of the war, when the council of the London borough of Stepney
			 elected him mayor. Attlee joined the House of Commons in 
			 <date type="appointmentdate" normal="1922">1922</date> and served as
			 under-secretary of state for war in the short-lived Labour administration of 
			 <date type="single" normal="1924">1924</date>. He also held several
			 posts in the 
			 <date type="single" normal="1929">1929</date> government. When, in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1931">1931</date>, Prime Minister James
			 Ramsay MacDonald ended the Labour government in order to form a "National
			 Government" with the Conservatives, Attlee joined the majority of his party in
			 disowning MacDonald's actions and going into opposition. The Labour meltdown of
			 the 
			 <date type="single" normal="1931">1931</date> election - when the
			 total number of Labour and allied MPs dropped to just 52 - turned out to be a
			 blessing in disguise for Attlee, as he was one of the few remaining
			 high-profile Labour MPs, and became deputy leader under George Lansbury (<date
			 type="life-span" normal="1859/1940">1859-1940</date>). During the 
			 <date type="single" normal="1935">1935</date> election campaign,
			 Lansbury resigned over his anti-war views, leaving the road clear for Attlee to
			 take control. He remained leader for 20 years.</p> 
		  <p> Attlee's important role in government came during World War 2.
			 Having edged (Arthur) Neville Chamberlain (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1869/1940">1869-1940</date>) out of office, the Labour party joined a
			 coalition administration under Winston Churchill (<date
			 type="life-span" normal="1874/1965">1874-1965</date>) in which several Labour
			 MPs played key roles. In 
			 <date type="appointmentdate" normal="1942">1942</date>, Attlee rose
			 to become deputy prime minister, a job he carried out with much skill, though
			 his careful and understated style contrasted with Churchill's charismatic
			 flamboyance.</p> 
		  <p> In the 
			 <date type="single" normal="1945">1945</date> election, much to
			 Attlee's surprise, the Labour party won a substantial majority after
			 campaigning for a "Socialist Commonwealth of Great Britain". The following six
			 years of government saw radical changes from the style of government of the
			 pre-war years. Many industries were nationalised, the embryonic welfare state
			 was enlarged, and free healthcare was introduced, as well as major reforms in
			 education, finance and urban planning. The statist policies of wartime were, if
			 anything, extended, and Britain saw what was probably its only true socialist
			 government. The election of 
			 <date type="single" normal="1951">1951</date> sent a mixed message.
			 Labour's vote was the largest ever received by a British political party, but
			 the complexity of the "first past the post" electoral system allowed his
			 wartime colleague Churchill to return to power despite getting less votes.
			 After a further defeat in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1955">1955</date>, Attlee resigned the
			 leadership of the Labour Party. He was immediately elevated to the House of
			 Lords.</p> 
		  <p> It is said that Attlee's skills were in detailed committee work and
			 making people with conflicting opinions and personalities work together, rather
			 than particular administrative skills. Nonetheless, despite the disastrous
			 final 20 months of his government after the indecisive 
			 <date type="single" normal="1950">1950</date> election (when several
			 cabinet ministers resigned because of the introduction of NHS charges and the
			 prosecution of the Korean War, denting Labour's wafer-thin majority), Attlee
			 remains one of the more successful British prime ministers of the
