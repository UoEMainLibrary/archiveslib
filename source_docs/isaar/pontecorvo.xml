		  <head>Occupation, Sphere of Activity</head> 
		  <p>Guido Pontecorvo's long association with animal genetics sprang from
			 his interest in biology whilst he was a schoolboy in his native Pisa. He
			 studied at Pisa University, and was already a reputable researcher in genetics
			 at Florence when he was dismissed as a result of the anti-semitism of the
			 Italian authorities during the fascist era. The head of Animal Genetics at
			 Edinburgh University, Alick Buchanan-Smith, had met 'Ponte' in Edinburgh the
			 previous year and offered him a research post. </p> 
		  <p>At King's Buildings Ponte worked with other European refugees who
			 were expert researchers in this field, and together they laid the foundations
			 at Edinburgh of a new phase of genetical science. Despite a period of
			 internment as an enemy alien, Pontecorvo completed his PhD (<date normal="1941"
			 type="single">1941</date>) on the chromosomes of fruit flies (Drosophila). In 
			 <date normal="1945" type="single">1945</date> he was appointed the
			 first lecturer in Genetics at Glasgow University, and under his professorship
			 of Genetics there from 
			 <date normal="1955/1968" type="inclusive">1955-1968</date> the
			 department gained an international reputation for the excellence of its
			 research.</p> 
		  <p>Later he switched from Drosophila to the genetics of the fungus
			 Aspergillus Nidulans because it allowed him to contribute towards the urgent
			 development of penicillin at the end of World War II, and also because it
			 allowed him to more easily study the structure and function of the gene -
			 rather than its biochemistry. This medium led to the discovery of asexual
			 reproduction (parasexual cycle) in fungi, and to his later theory that the gene
			 was a functional unit. He was thus a pioneer of microbial genetics, or more
			 specifically the genetics of mutation and chromosomal translocations, and the
			 genetics of a new micro-organism. </p> 
		  <p>Independently he also recognised, correctly, that the parasexual
			 cycle if studied in cell cultures would contribute to the knowledge of human
			 genetics. From 
			 <date normal="1968/1975" type="inclusive">1968-1975</date> he was at
			 the Imperial Cancer Research Fund laboratories in London. Whilst working there
			 on mammalian cancer he devised the polyethylene glycol method of fusing animal
			 cells. A building at Glasgow University has been named in his honour.</p>

		  <head>Relationships</head> 
		  <p>Pontecorvo's studies in genetics were inspired whilst assisting the
			 plant geneticist E. Avanzi at the Faculty of Agriculture in Florence. His first
			 collaborator in Scotland was the German geneticist, Hermann Muller 
			 <date normal="1890/1967" type="inclusive">1890-1967</date> with whom
			 he developed a method of producing sterile hybrids from crossing species. At
			 Edinburgh too he discovered in collaboration with J.A. Roper in 
			 <date normal="1950" type="single">1950</date> the cycle that causes
			 genetic re-assortment without sexual reproduction (parasexual cycle). Whilst at
			 Glasgow he and E. Kafer mapped new mutations in a single step and chromosomal
			 translocations in A. nidulans.</p>
