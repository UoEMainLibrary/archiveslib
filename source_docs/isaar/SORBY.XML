		  <p>Henry Clifton Sorby (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1826/1908">1826-1908</date>), a geologist and metallurgist, was
			 introduced to science at the age of fifteen, when he won a book entitled
			 <bibref>'<title>Readings in Science</title>' (<imprint><date type="publication"
			 normal="1833">1833</date></imprint>)</bibref> for the best maths score in his
			 class. His choice of field of study was probably influenced by his background
			 as the son of a cutler, from a family of cutlers, in Sheffield, Britain's steel
			 capital. While he did study at school and under a private tutor, Sorby never
			 attended university, saying that he wanted an education "not [in order] to pass
			 an examination but to qualify myself for a career of original investigation."
			 This spirit of "original investigation" lived on, and he never worked for an
			 institution, and he financed his work himself. He is said to have been one of
			 the last important independent amateur scientists.</p> 
		  <p>Sorby's principal legacy to the science of geology is microscopical
			 petrography, the study of rock samples through a polarising microscope. He was
			 ridiculed at the time for "studying mountains with a microscope", but he always
			 defended himself, and insisted that details were important, regardless of size.
			 He also turned his microscope onto iron and steel, and found that steel in
			 particular, had a structure that resembled a rock - he found crystalline
			 elements and a far less uniform structure than had been assumed until then.</p>
		  
		  <p>Sorby emerged with an enhanced reputation from the debate over slaty
			 cleavage. Slaty cleavage occurs when slate cracks in a different direction to
			 the strata that make it up. He proved this phenomenon occurs when slate is
			 deformed by non-uniform pressure that reorients the mica particles contained
			 within the rock. He followed a slightly different route when investigating
			 sandstone. He carried out practical experiments on the deposition of sand from
			 water in various conditions, and was thus able to explain, in commendable
			 detail, the manner in which various sandstone deposits had been created.</p> 
		  <p>Sorby also used spectrum analysis of minerals and biological matter.
			 He believed he had found a new element in the mineral jargon with this method -
			 which he tentatively named 'jargonium' - only to find that the spectrum lines
			 were caused by uranium. With his spectrum method, he identified carotene during
			 his studies of pigmentation in plants and animals.</p> 
		  <p>In 
			 <date type="single" normal="1878">1878</date>, Sorby acquired a
			 yacht, the 'Glimpse', which he equipped as a full floating laboratory, in which
			 he spent the summer months of the next 25 years touring Britain in. He left the
			 bulk of his library and money to the newly created University of Sheffield,
			 which he had been a strong supporter of.</p> 
		  <p>He wrote approximately 240 scientific papers in his lifetime.</p>
