		  <p>John Walker became interested in botany at an early age, but this
			 was not his only scientific interest: "I began to collect minerals in the year
			 1746" he later wrote. He entered the University of Edinburgh to prepare for the
			 ministry in the Established (Presbyterian) Church of Scotland. At university he
			 was attracted by the chemistry courses given by Professor William Cullen. With
			 Cullen and other friends at university he made many collecting trips. It was
			 also whilst at university that the young Walker became interested in the museum
			 display of natural history, a collection which was already greatly revered. In 
			 <date normal="1779" type="appointmentdate">1779</date> he was to
			 become the keeper of the Museum.</p> 
		  <p>In 
			 <date normal="1758" type="single">1758</date> Walker wrote his first
			 scientific paper, an account of a medicine well. It was also at about this time
			 that Walker made the acquaintance of Henry Home, Lord Kames, who greatly
			 influenced his early career as a natural historian. From 
			 <date normal="1758/1762" type="inclusive">1758-1762</date> he was
			 minister at Glencorse in Midlothian, and from 
			 <date normal="1762/1783" type="inclusive">1762-1783</date> minister
			 at Moffat. During this period he undertook extensive tours in the Scottish
			 Highlands. Walker's manuscripts cover a wide range of his interests and
			 activities. Of particular note to students of botany are the volumes in which
			 Walker annually noted interesting records, many from Edinburgh and its
			 environs, supplied by Mr Yalden.</p> 
		  <p>In 
			 <date normal="1764" type="single">1764</date> Walker was appointed by
			 Lord Kames to make a survey of the Hebrides and the Highlands. The Hebrides
			 were poor and undeveloped and Walker was selected by Lord Kames to highlight
			 the problems in an attempt to improve the situation, being at the same time
			 commissioned to make a report to the Society for the Propagation of Christian
			 Knowledge. In order to complete the survey Walker travelled three thousand
			 miles in seven months, and the resulting report was eventually printed by his
			 friend Charles Stewart under the title an <bibref><title>Economical History of
			 the Hebrides</title></bibref> in 
			 <date normal="1808" type="publication">1808</date>.</p> 
		  <p>Walker was appointed regius professor of natural history at the
			 University of Edinburgh in 
			 <date normal="1779" type="chairdate">1779</date> while also
			 continuing his pastoral duties at Moffat. This ultimately proved impractical
			 and four years on he was transferred to the parish of Colinton. The subjects
			 that he covered in his lectures included: botany, geology, hydrography,
			 meteorology, mineralogy and zoology. His lectures on agriculture as part of his
			 natural history course were the first in an English-speaking university. It has
			 been said that Walker represents the link betweeen a mediaeval and a new modern
			 geology. </p>

				century</date>, including: Carl Linnaeus, James Hutton, John Hope, John
			 Playfair, Sir James Hall, Joseph Black and Benjamin Franklin. As professor,
			 Walker taught many students who later became important figures in their own
			 right; these included: Robert Jameson, Robert Brown and James Edward Smith.
