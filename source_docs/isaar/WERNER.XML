		  <p>Abraham Gottlob Werner was born in Wehrau, Upper Lusatia, now Polish
			 Osiecznica, on 
			 <date type="birth" normal="17490925">25 September 1749</date>. He had
			 a boy's interest in rocks and minerals, which his father indulged while also
			 arranging private tuition in other things and packing him off to the
			 Waisenschule at Bunzlau (Boleslawiec). Werner's father was inspector of the
			 Duke of Solm's ironworks, and he wished his son to join him there one day.
			 Abraham clerked in the foundry during his 'teens, and began his managerial
			 studies in Freiburg's new Bergakademie. He jumped ship to join the Saxon mining
			 service instead of returning to the Duke of Solm's employ. He began the
			 required course in jurisprudence at the University of Leipzig, but left without
			 a degree once again, still distracted by mineralogy and lately historical
			 linguistics. Geology and language, he felt, were records of analogous
			 importance in the history of man. He freelanced a 
			 <date type="publication" normal="1773">1773</date> book on how to
			 recognize fossils, and this, with the intervention of an older friend, finally
			 got him a solid job, a teaching appointment in the mining curriculum back at
			 the Bergakademie, along with curatorship of the mineral collection there. He
			 stayed at these twin posts for his remaining 42 years. He died in Dresden on 
			 <date type="death" normal="18170630">30 June 1817</date>. </p> 
		  <p>Werner the mineralogist, recognizing that chemistry and
			 crystallography were not sophisticated enough to help establish a mineralogical
			 system, worked up simple descriptive standards of classification instead, sure
			 enough for the time being that external characteristics were not unrelated to
			 chemical makeup. This was worth doing, he insisted, because mineralogy itself
			 was the starting point for all study of the the earth. He discovered eight new
			 minerals of his own in the course of all this. Werner the geologist was the
			 first to work out a complete schema for the earth's structure, and in
			 particular, the history of its formation. His account of things, the work of a
			 nominal Pietist but a temperamental deist, avoided the biblically-charged
			 problem of the flood. At least he was neptunist, not a vulcanist, observed
			 traditionalists, who were mostly pacified. He believed that all rock was once
			 sediment or precipitate in a universal ocean. His career's biggest controversy
			 was with other geologists, the great debate over whether basalt is of aqueous
			 or volcanic origin. </p>
