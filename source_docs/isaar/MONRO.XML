		  <p>Alexander Monro (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1733/1817">1733-1817</date>), Professor of Anatomy and Surgery at the
			 University of Edinburgh, was a member of a family of anatomists - he followed
			 his father in his post and his son followed him. He was educated at the High
			 School in Edinburgh and then, from age 12, at the city's university. At
			 university, he studied mathematics and philosophy (in which he did not
			 graduate, as was the custom with arts students) before specialising in
			 medicine. He became a Doctor of Medicine in

		  <p>In 
			 <date type="appointmentdate" normal="1754">1754</date>, Monro was
			 appointed as conjoint Professor of Anatomy and Surgery, along with his father.
			 Monro was a popular lecturer - his post was granted after students of his
			 father (for whom he occasionally lectured before he gained his own position)
			 expressed their approval of his teaching. He eventually took over the full
			 responsibilities and the title of Professor of Anatomy and Surgery. His skills
			 encouraged growing numbers to attend his lectures, and attendance reached a
			 peak of 436 in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1783">1783</date>. Though Monro was an
			 anatomist, not a surgeon, his jealousy made him block all attempts to establish
			 a separate chair of surgery at the university.</p> 
		  <p>Monro is notable for the medical records he kept (10,007 cases
			 detailed in 33 volumes) and for his discovery of the Foramen of Monro, which
			 links the lateral and third ventricles of the brain. This discovery was
			 explained in his publication, <bibref><title>Observations on the Structure and
			 Functions of the Nervous System</title></bibref>.</p>

		  <p>Alexander Monro was the youngest son of Alexander Monro, his
			 predecessor in the chair of Anatomy and Surgery at the University of Edinburgh.
			 His own son, Alexander Monro, succeeded him in the chair of Anatomy and
			 Surgery, and lectured, among other things, on the phrenology of serial killer
			 Burke, whose body he had dissected.</p>
