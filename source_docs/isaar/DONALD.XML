		  <p>Hugh Donald, was a key figure in the improvement of the science and
			 practise of animal production. He was born in New Zealand and educated at the
			 New Zealand agricultural college, Lincoln College, where he was a brilliant
			 student and acquired three degrees by the age of 26. Initially he trained as a
			 plant geneticist with an interest in discovering new varieties of wheat. In the
			 early 
			 <date normal="1930/1939" certainty="uncertain"
			  type="inclusive">1930s</date> there were few opportunities in this field and he
			 was advised by the plant geneticist, Otto Frankel (<date normal="1900/1998"
			 type="life-span">1900-1998</date>), to switch to animal work. At that date
			 Edinburgh was one of very few places in the world that was developing animal
			 genetics, so in 
			 <date normal="1934" type="single">1934</date> he joined the Institute
			 of Animal Genetics at Edinburgh University. However, Edinburgh had poor
			 facilities for livestock work, and so for two years he worked on Drosophila
			 with Rowena Lamy. </p> 
		  <p>Shortly after completing his PhD thesis (<date normal="1936"
			 type="single">1936</date>) Donald was appointed junior lecturer at the
			 Shotthead Farm under Alick Buchanan-Smith. Here he ran the farm (doing much of
			 the manual work), the breeding programme, he did research and taught
			 undergraduates. In the 
			 <date normal="1930/1939" type="inclusive"
			  certainty="uncertain">1930s</date> he worked with cytologists, geneticists,
			 pharmacologists and his colleagues included Auerbach, Muller, Greenwood,
			 Buchanan-Smith and Koller who all contributed to the new science of
			 agricultural and pure genetics. Donald improved the quality and production of
			 pigs, and by extension led to the improved quality of livestock generally. Much
			 of his work emphasised the social and economic context for improved livestock
			 and hence was particularly relevant for developing nations. </p> 
		  <p>In the 
			 <date normal="1970/1979" type="inclusive"
			  certainty="uncertain">1970s</date> he described how the Edinburgh Institute
			 under the leadership of Francis Crew in the 
			 <date normal="1930/1939" type="inclusive"
			  certainty="uncertain">1930s</date> combined laboratory work and practice in a
			 multidisciplinary scientific setting. For Donald this was enormously
			 stimulating and beneficial. He fostered this approach during his years as
			 Director of the Agricultural Research Council's Animal Breeding Research
			 Organisation (ABRO) in Edinburgh. ABRO grew under his directorship to run six
			 farms in the UK developing improved breeds such as Friesian, Ayrshire, Jersey
			 cattle, and Blackface sheep. Donald was one of the first scientists to transfer
			 embryos between different varieties of sheep. His studies of identical and
			 fraternal twin cattle successfully improved fertility, body weight and milk
			 flow. </p> 
		  <p>In the 
			 <date normal="1950/1959" certainty="uncertain"
			 type="inclusive">1950s</date> Hugh Donald laid the foundation for human organ
			 transplantation when he grafted skin between cattle twins. He was committed to
			 the wider vision, and both his writings and his work contained an astute
			 awareness of the ethical, economic and political controversies and future
			 direction of animal breeding.</p>
