		  <p>William Buckland (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1784/1856">1784-1856</date>), a reverend's son from Devon, was an
			 eminent geologist and academic, as well as a prominent moderate Anglican
			 priest. He was educated at St. Mary's College, Winchester and at Corpus Christi
			 College, Oxford, from which he graduated with a BA in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1805">1805</date>. In 
			 <date type="appointmentdate" normal="1808">1808</date>, he was
			 ordained as a priest, and in 
			 <date type="appointmentdate" normal="1813">1813</date> he was
			 appointed as a reader in mineralogy at the University of Oxford. Contrary to
			 some references, Buckland was not actually a professor. The confusion arises
			 because he published his works as "professor Buckland" in London, no doubt to
			 be taken more seriously. As well as his academic duties, he was Canon of Christ
			 Church Cathedral in Oxford, chairman of the Oxford Gas Company, and also a
			 practical geologist applying his knowledge, for example, to farm drainage.</p> 
		  <p>While not a radical thinker - no sweeping new theories came from him
			 - Buckland was a competent, though not universally respected geologist, due to
			 his eccentric and decidedly un-Victorian enthusiasm for his subject. Among his
			 important discoveries were deposits of coprolites (fossilised faeces) at Lyme
			 Regis, which proved the carnivorous nature of certain ancient animals, and
			 signs of ancient glacial erosion in Scotland, which led to the theory of
			 glaciation being expounded, though he was never entirely comfortable with it.
			 At one point, Buckland also believed he had proved the existence of the flood,
			 by looking at strata and fossil remains in caves, though he later came to a
			 compromise view, where the landscape of Britain was formed by a combination of
			 glaciation and floodwater from the glaciers.</p> 
		  <p>Buckland is said to have been an entertaining and eloquent speaker
			 on his subject, which led some to appreciate his work all the more and led
			 others to despise him for "reducing the science to buffoonry".</p> 
		  <p>There are conflicting reports of the number of scientific papers he
			 wrote; the Royal Society talks of 53, Agassiz talks of 66.</p>
