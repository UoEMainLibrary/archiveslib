		  <p>Robert Ball (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1802/1857">1802-1857</date>), the Irish naturalist, was educated at
			 Ballitore, County Kildare, by a certain Mr White, who is said to have supported
			 the child's early inquisitiveness and interest in natural history. Aged 22,
			 Ball showed his belief in public service, by accepting appointment as a
			 magistrate.</p> 
		  <p>The years 
			 <date type="inclusive" normal="1827/1852">1827-1852</date> were spent
			 as a civil servant in the under-secretary's office in Dublin. He was repeatedly
			 refused promotion because he was considered to be too good at his job to be
			 moved. He continued scientific work in his free time and went on scientific
			 expeditions during his holidays. Eventually, he was pushed into retirement
			 because his superiors disapproved of their employee carrying out scientific
			 work.</p> 
		  <p>Ball held a number of positions in Irish learned societies, and he
			 was also director of the museum at Trinity College, Dublin, to which he gave
			 his considerable collection of zoological specimens. The College awarded him an
			 honorary doctorate in gratitude for this.</p> 
		  <p>Ball wrote no books, but he published a number of papers, on the
			 subject of fossil bears found in Ireland, the remains of oxen found in bogs,
			 and other topics in the field of zoology.</p>
