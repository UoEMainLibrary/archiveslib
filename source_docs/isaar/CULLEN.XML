		  <p>William Cullen was born in Hamilton, Lanarkshire, Scotland, 
			 <date type="birth" normal="17100415">15 April 1710</date>. His father
			 was a lawyer, on special retainer to the Duke of Hamilton; his mother was of
			 the Roberton family of Whistlebury. He attended the Hamilton Grammar School,
			 and in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1726">1726</date> began an arts course in
			 general studies in the University of Glasgow. Following an interest in
			 medicine, he apprenticed himself as surgeon apothecary to John Paisley of
			 Glasgow, spent 
			 <date type="appointment" normal="1729">1729</date> as surgeon to a
			 West Indies merchant vessel, and 
			 <date type="appointment" normal="1730/1731">1730 and '31</date> as
			 assistant apothecary to Mr Murray of Henrietta Street, London, and in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1732">1732</date> he started general
			 medical practice in Shotts, Lanarkshire. A small legacy in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1733">1733</date> financed more private
			 study in general literature and philosophy and sent him to Edinburgh University
			 for formal medical classes. He returned to Hamilton in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1736">1736</date>, a physician and
			 surgeon, and by 
			 <date type="single" normal="1740">1740</date> held a Glasgow medical
			 degree at last. He married in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1741">1741</date>, started his family,
			 and settled into terms as a town councillor and magistrate. He also became
			 ordinary medical attendant to James, 5th Duke of Hamilton (<date
			 type="appointment" normal="1703/1743">1703-43</date>), and his family, and his
			 livestock. Cullen had been interested in chemistry since Edinburgh, and the
			 Duke intended to equip a laboratory for him, and to make him superintendent of
			 the Palace gardens. But the Duke died in 
			 <date type="death" normal="1743">1743</date>, and in the next year
			 the Cullens moved to Glasgow, where father practised physic and lectured
			 extramurally in physiology, botany, and materia medica. Dr Johnstone, Professor
			 of Medicine, let him teach chemistry as its own subject, a novel idea, and by 
			 <date type="appointmentdate" normal="1747">1747</date> there was
			 money for the first independent lectureship in chemistry, occupied by Cullen
			 and one John Carrick, assistant to Robert Hamilton, Professor of Anatomy;
			 Carrick died soon after, and was not replaced. In 
			 <date type="appointmentdate" normal="1751">1751</date> Cullen took
			 the chair of medicine vacated by Johnstone, continuing with chemistry lectures
			 as best he could, then leapt to Edinburgh in 
			 <date type="appointmentdate" normal="1755">1755</date>, when Dr
			 Plummer, his old chemistry lecturer, died. In 
			 <date type="appointmentdate" normal="1766">1766</date> he succeeded
			 Robert Whytt in the Edinburgh chair of the Institutes (theory) of Medicine,
			 later sharing lectures with John Gregory in alternate years in the practice of
			 physic, into whose chair he moved in 
			 <date type="appointmentdate" normal="1773">1773</date>. Cullen was a
			 fine administrator, who helped found the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the
			 Royal Medical Society (Edinburgh). For all his academic leadership he was
			 elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London 
			 <date type="appointmentdate" normal="1777">1777</date>, though he
			 never signed the roll attesting formal admission. He died in Edinburgh on 
			 <date type="death" normal="17900205">5 February 1790</date>, and lies
			 interred nearby in the village of Kirknewton. </p> 
		  <p>Cullen the chemist was unoriginal but enlightened. His papers, none
			 ever published, show that he was willing to distinguish acids and alkalies from
			 "salts", to acknowledge the legitimacy of Boyle's atoms, and to give symbolic
			 precision to the affinity tables then in widespread use. Cullen the man of
			 medicine, who published only marginally, was reasonably forward-thinking as
			 well, especially in matters of nosology. It was Cullen the teacher who shone
			 brightest. He was deeply entrenched in Lockean empirical philosophy, and his
			 practical lectures, in accessible English, with student-led, hands-on
			 demonstrations, made his courses famous as far away as Philadelphia. He
			 evangelized for chemistry as its own academic subject, and stressed its
			 practical applications to mining, agriculture, and manufacture. Cullen's
			 empirical practicality finally made him famous as a general scientist too. His
			 only important paper was the writeup of his 
			 <date type="publication" normal="1756">1756</date> demonstration of
			 someone else's postulated usefulness of the cold that accompanies evaporating
			 fluids. He froze water to prove that the principles worked. </p> 
		</occsphere> 
		<relships encodinganalog="isaar228"> 
		  <head>Relationships</head> 
		  <p>Two most important academic mentors in Cullen's life were Robert
			 Simson (<date type="lifespan" normal="1687/1768">1687-1768</date>), the Glasgow
			 mathematician who helped foster his interest in science and who supported him
			 later as a young professor, and Andrew Plummer (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1698/1756">1698-1756</date>), experimental chemist in the medical
			 school in Edinburgh and disciple of the influential Herman Boerhaave (<date
			 type="life-span" normal="1668/1738">1668-1738</date>). </p> 
		  <p> His great non-faculty patrons were Archibald Campbell, 3rd Duke of
			 Argyll (<date type="life-span" normal="1682/1761">1682-1761</date>), lawyer and
			 politician, who got him his Edinburgh chemistry chair; Henry Home, Lorde Kames
			 (<date type="life-span" normal="1696/1782">1696-1782</date>), judge,
			 agriculturalist and philosopher, who enticed him to Edinburgh; and George
			 Drummond (<date type="life-span" normal="1687-1766">1687-1766</date>),
			 financier and politician, responsible for the building of the Royal Infirmary
			 and the medical school. </p> 
		  <p> Cullen's favourite colleagues included young Lanarkshire friend
			 William Hunter (<date type="life-span" normal="1718/1783">1718-83</date>), who
			 became a celebrated anatomist and obstetrician; he was surgeon apothecary
			 apprentice to Cullen for three years in Hamilton, and boarded in his house.
			 Cullen later introduced him to another Lanarkshire friend, William Smellie
			 (<date type="life-span" normal="1697/1763">1697-1763</date>), master of British
			 midwifery, who helped set Hunter up in his London practice. There were also
			 John Carrick, fellow lecturer in chemistry at Edinburgh, and John Rutherford
			 (<date type="life-span" normal="1695/1779">1695-1779</date>), Alexander Monro
			 (<date type="life-span" normal="1697-1767">1697-1767</date>), and Robert Whytt
			 (<date type="life-span" normal="1714/1766">1714-1766</date>), all fellow
			 teachers in clinical medicine. A fellow practical scientist was Francis Home
			 (<date type="life-span" normal="1719/1813">1719-1813</date>), Professor of
			 Materia Medica at Edinburgh; like Cullen, he worked on the chemistry of linen
			 bleaching. </p> 
		  <p>Numerous Cullen students went on to become important scientists in
			 their own right. Joseph Black (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1728/1799">1728-1799</date>) discovered carbon dioxide. A true
			 procedural prot&#x00C3;&#x00A9;g&#x00C3;&#x00A9; of his master, he was first to
			 use a balance in a planned set of experiments, in the manner of a modern
			 quantitative chemist. Other luminaries were Robert William (<date
			 type="life-span" normal="1757/1812">1757-1812</date>), William Withering (<date
			 type="life-span" normal="1741-1799">1741-1799</date>), John Rogerson (<date
			 type="life-span" normal="1741/1823">1741-1823</date>), Sir Gilbert Blane (<date
			 type="life-span" normal="1749/1834">1749-1834</date>), John Haygarth (<date
			 type="life-span" normal="1740/1827">1740-1827</date>), John Coakley Lettsom
			 (<date type="life-span" normal="1744-1813">1744-1813</date>), and Dr John Brown
			 (<date type="life-span" normal="1735/1788">1735-1788</date>). There was also
			 unfortunately Dr James Graham (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1745/1794">1745-1794</date>), a famous quack, who ran a sumptuous
			 Temple of Health in London. One of his scantily-clad goddesses of health was
			 Lady Emma Hamilton (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1765/1815">1765-1815</date>), n&#x00E9;e Emma Noble, more famous as
			 Lord Nelson's mistress. Legitimate enthusiasts of Cullen's teaching methods
			 overseas were prominent Americans like John Morgan (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1753/1789">1753-89</date>), Benjamin Rush (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1745/1813">1745-1813</date>), Thomas Parke, Wiliam Shippen (<date
			 type="life-span" normal="1736/1808">1736-1808</date>), Adam Kuhn (<date
			 type="life-span" normal="1741/1817">1741-1817</date>), and Benjamin Franklin
			 (<date type="life-span" normal="1706/1790">1706-1790</date>). </p> 
		  <p>Dr Cullen had famous acquaintances outside the sciences. One of them
			 was another new appointment in Glasgow, an economist named Adam Smith (<date
			 type="life-span" normal="1723/1790">1723-90</date>). Another in Glasgow was one
			 David Hume (<date type="life-span" normal="1711/1776">1711-76</date>). In 
			 <date type="single" normal="1773">1773</date> Dr Cullen dined with Dr
			 Johnson, who found him very entertaining. </p> 
		  <p>Mrs Cullen was born Anna Johnstone, daughter of the Reverend Robert
			 Johnstone of Kilbarchan. </p>
