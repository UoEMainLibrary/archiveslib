		  <p>Sir John Bretland Farmer (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1865/1944">1865-1944</date>) was an important botanist at the Royal
			 College of Science (now Imperial College, London) who pioneered the teaching of
			 skills useful for applied botany in the British colonies, transformed his
			 university department and was responsible for a number of scientific studies
			 into chromosomes, cancer and plant physiology.</p> 
		  <p>While studying at Magdalen College, Oxford, Farmer was influenced by
			 Isaac Bayley Balfour (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1853/1922">1853-1922</date>), who was at the time the Sherardian
			 professor of botany. Balfour encouraged Farmer to concentrate on botany, which
			 he did. He graduated with first class honours in Natural Science in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1883">1883</date>.</p> 
		  <p>A formative experience in Farmer's life was his trip to Ceylon (now
			 Sri Lanka). During this journey, in which he gained experience of the
			 agricultural systems in use in the colonies, and the problems faced by mass
			 agriculture in a tropical climate, he became convinced of the necessity of
			 teaching students the practical details of botany, as well as the theoretical
			 approach, so that they could be of use to this industry. When he took charge of
			 the botany section at the Royal College of Science, he became the first to
			 teach in this unconventional manner.</p> 
		  <p>Among the subjects discussed in his publications were cancerous
			 tissues. Farmer argued that cancerous tissue was made up of cells that had
			 developed into "gametoid" form - they had taken on characteristics of
			 reproductive (gametogenic) cells. Another of his publications reported an
			 experiment he had conducted which showed that certain oxygen-requiring
			 biological processes in plants could continue without an external source of
			 oxygen, providing they were illuminated. This he explained by the production in
			 the plants by respiration of oxygen from carbon dioxide. In other works, Farmer
			 coined the terms 'meiosis' and 'meiotic', investigated wood's ability to
			 conduct water and disproved (in association with Miss L. Digby a theory
			 relating the size of chromosomes with the type of animal. </p> 
		  <p>Farmer was appointed by the government to investigate the workings
			 of the agriculture departments of Britain's non self-governing colonies. The
			 recommendations he made, based in part on his experiences of Ceylon and his
			 experience as professor of botany, made a considerable impact on the
			 agricultural techniques of these territories.</p>
