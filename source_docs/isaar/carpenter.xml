		  <p>William Benjamin Carpenter, leading light among early naturalists,
			 was born in Exeter on 
			 <date type="birth" normal="18131029">29 October 1813</date>, and died
			 in London<date type="death" normal="18851119">19 November 1885</date>. He
			 attended his father's school in Bristol, and then apprenticed himself to local
			 medical man John Bishop Estlin. Carpenter saw the West Indies as a companion to
			 a patient, then in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1835">1835</date> entered University
			 College, London and the Royal College of Surgeons for formal training of his
			 own. His M.D. finally came from the University of Edinburgh in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1839">1839</date>. This he took to
			 Bristol, to try clinical medicine for a few years, but decamped quickly for
			 London, to take up academic appointments at University College, the Royal
			 Institution, and the London Hospital. For the next four decades he researched
			 and published prodigiously, in fields as far apart as mental physiology,
			 microscopy, marine biology, and religion. </p> 
		  <p>He was justly influential. His first contribution was on the
			 function of the ventral cord ganglia of the arthropods. His next was a
			 controversial notion of "unconscious cerebration", in which the physiology of
			 thought and feeling takes place in the brain. Colleagues who disapproved of
			 "Brain-change" postulated reflex actions to stimuli elsewhere in the body
			 instead. Following one corollary of Brain-change, Carpenter prefigured
			 Pavlovian behaviourists, thinking it possible to train animals and children
			 with a battery of the right "motives". Thinking in wider terms, he found he
			 could lend most of his weight to Darwin and his evolutionary principles, which
			 pleased Darwin very much. He also did a great deal to elevate the teaching of
			 science in universities, and, with the famous Gilchrist lectures, to extend
			 science to the very working classes. His later achievements were in marine
			 zoology, where he described and classified the Foraminifera, ancient and
			 living, laid out a pioneering doctrine of general oceanic circulation, and read
			 a series of startling papers on the animal nature of Eozoon canadense. Dr
			 Carpenter, erstwhile clinician, founded a Marine Biological Assocation, with a
			 productive laboratory on Plymouth Sound. </p>

		<relships encodinganalog="isaar228"> 
		  <head>Relationships</head> 
		  <p>Johannes Muller was the physiologist who translated Carpenter's
			 influental graduate thesis in 
			 <date type="publication" normal="1840">1840</date>, on the
			 invertebrate ventral cord ganglia. Thomas Laycock was the physiologist who
			 claimed priority in the idea of Brain-change. John Stuart Mill affirmed the
			 reasonableness of Brain-change as a physiological construct; Sir William
			 Hamilton thought it made better sense metaphysically. Charles Darwin was
			 gratified by Carpenter's overall approval of his principles of natural
			 selection. The educationalist Herbert Spencer welcomed Carpenter's ideas on the
			 teaching of science. Charles Wyville Thomson, Professor of Natural History at
			 the University of Edinburgh, collaborated with Carpenter in dredging operations
			 off the Scottish and Irish coasts, and in publishing their findings on the
			 Crinoidea. The two men also worked together in planning the
			 government-sponsored scientific voyage of H.M.S. Challenger (<date
			 type="inclusive" normal="1873/1876">1873-1876</date>). Carpenter's younger
			 brother, Philip Pearsall, was a famous conchologist. One of the five sons
			 produced by Carpenter's marriage to Louisa Powell in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1840">1840</date> was Philip Herbert, a
			 master at Eton and a zoologist, who assisted his father and wrote extensively
			 on fossils himself. </p> 
		  <p> Carpenter the staunch religionist (his essay topics included
			 teetotalism and scriptural problems with Darwinism) was the son of Dr Lant
			 Carpenter, a Unitarian minister. Carpenter the social activist had a sister,
			 Mary, who helped found the ragged school movement. </p>
