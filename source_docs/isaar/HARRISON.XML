		  <p>John Harrison (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1693/1776">1693-1776</date>), winner of the Board of Longitude's prize,
			 probably inherited his interest for horology from his father, a carpenter by
			 trade, who occasionally repaired clocks. Harrison never had a good education,
			 and it is said that he never learned to express himself well in writing.</p> 
		  <p>His first clock was built in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1713">1713</date>, and much of his early
			 work was built in collaboration with his brother, James. Together, they
			 revolutionised clock design by completely eliminating the need for lubrication.
			 Until then, poor clock oil had been one of the largest causes of clock failure.
			 John Harrison also invented the gridiron pendulum, made of alternate rods of
			 steel and brass, whose relative dilations cancel each other out when the
			 pendulum is heated. This meant that warm weather no longer made clocks run
			 slow. Timepieces equipped with the gridiron pendulum were superior in accuracy
			 to the best clocks of the day. Around the same time, he also introduced a
			 second spring into clocks, to keep them running while they were being wound
			 up.</p> 
		  <p>Knowing of the Board of Longitude's series of prizes for finding
			 methods of measuring longitude - including the top prize of
			 &#x00C2;&#x00A3;20,000 for finding it accurate to within 30 miles, Harrison
			 adapted his techniques to build a series of clocks which would remain accurate
			 at sea, where waves would make traditional pendulum clocks erratic. The time
			 shown on the clock could then be compared with the local time, which could be
			 ascertained from astronomical observations, to find the position's longitude.
			 His fourth clock, which finally won the prize, was a massive improvement on
			 other clocks of the day. It was also considerably smaller than anything he had
			 built before, looking more like a large pocket watch, 13cm in diameter and
			 weighing 1.45kg. During a four month voyage to Jamaica in 
			 <date type="inclusive" normal="1761/1762">1761-1762</date>, it lost
			 only five seconds - which translates as 18 miles accuracy, well within the
			 limit for the top Longitude prize. On a later journey, the inaccuracy was
			 reduced further.</p> 
		  <p>However, hostility from certain members of the Royal Society - who
			 hoped to win the prize themselves - led to extra hurdles being placed in
			 Harrison's path, including more, lengthier tests, demands of several more
			 prototypes and the surrender of his creations and their designs to the
			 government. Even after these obstructions were cleared, the Board remained
			 reluctant, and it took the intervention of the King and Parliament for Harrison
			 to get his prize. This only happened in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1773">1773</date>, nearly twelve years
			 after he had fulfilled the original conditions, and only a few years before his
			 death.</p>
