		  <p>Sir Robert Christison (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1797/1882">1797-1882</date>) was the son of a professor of humanity
			 (Latin). He was educated at the University of Edinburgh, where he studied
			 medicine. After a spell in London and Paris, he was appointed Professor of
			 Medical Jurisprudence (forensic medicine) at Edinburgh in 
			 <date type="chairdate" normal="1822">1822</date>. In his role as an
			 expert on toxicology and physiology, he was a key witness in many criminal
			 trials in Scotland and England, notably that of serial killer William Burke
			 (<date type="life-span" normal="1792/1829">1792-1829</date>), where he used as
			 evidence the distinctive differences between injuries inflicted before and
			 after death, which had not been previously commented upon in trials. This
			 observation is said to have been crucial in securing Burke's conviction.</p> 
		  <p>While professor of medical jurisprudence, he conducted research in
			 toxicology with his colleague Dr Coindet. He wrote a treatise on poisons, part
			 of which he had researched by risking his own life ingesting toxic substances.
			 He studied, in particular, the effects of oxalic acid, but also lead, arsenic,
			 opium and hemlock.</p> 
		  <p>In 
			 <date type="single" normal="1832">1832</date>, Christison resigned
			 his chair to become Professor of Materia Medica and therapeutics at Edinburgh
			 University. It was in this post that he spent the bulk of his exceptionally
			 long (55 years) professorial career. In this job, he wrote several books,
			 including one on kidney conditions. During his tenure he also acted as
			 physician in ordinary to the Queen in Scotland, was president, for a time, of
			 the British Medical Association, the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Royal
			 College of Physicians in Edinburgh. He was also active within the University of
			 Edinburgh, and he was well known for his ferocious opposition to the admission
			 of women to the medical faculty.</p>
