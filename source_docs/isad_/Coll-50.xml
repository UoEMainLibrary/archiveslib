      <p>Poet and author George Mackay Brown was born in Stromness, Orkney, 17
		  October 1921 where he lived much of his life. He attended Edinburgh University
		  as a mature student in the late-1950s after preparatory studies at Newbattle
		  Abbey College, near Edinburgh. George Mackay Brown believed that his place as a
		  writer was at the heart of the community into which he was born, but although
		  his work is confined in place it has a broad range, from plays, children's
		  books, essays, to novels and short stories. It is for his novels though that he
		  is most famous, 
		Greenvoe  1972), 
		Magnus  (1973), 
		Beside the ocean of time  (1994). Short stories have
		included 
		A calendar of love  (1967) and 
		A time to keep . Poetry has included 
		Loaves and fishes  (1959), 
		The year of the whale  (1968), and 
		The wreck of the Archangel  (1995), the latter which
		earned him a Booker Prize short list citation in 1994 and the Saltire Scottish
		Book of the Year Award, 1995. George Mackay Brown died in Kirkwall, Orkney, 13
		April 1996 </p>
