      <p>The Edinburgh Association for the University Education of Women
		  (EAUEW) had its roots in the second half of the nineteenth century. The first
		  Association of its kind in Scotland, it was involved in a flourishing campaign
		  - part of the wider women's movement - promoting the provision of higher
		  education for women. Prior to this, women had rarely attended University of
		  Edinburgh lectures, although, of course, Dr James Barry had graduated M.D. from
		  Edinburgh in 1812 - serving in the British Army as a medical officer - and on
		  death had been discovered to be a woman. With the arrival of Sophia Jex-Blake
		  in Edinburgh in the 1860s and the vigorous campaign for the medical education
		  of women, the nation-wide demand for women to be offered the same educational
		  opportunities as men - in general arts education or medical subjects - was
		  highlighted. On 15 October 1868, the forerunner of the EAUEW was founded - the
		  Edinburgh Ladies Education Association (ELEA) - at 1 Inverleith Terrace,
		  Edinburgh, and the following year, in 1869, Jex-Blake won the right for women
		  to attend medical classes in the separate Extra-Mural School. The guiding force
		  behind the setting up of the ELEA however, was Mrs Mary Crudelius. Its aim was
		  not to threaten any professional status, but to cultivate and improve the mind
		  through its lectures. Crudelius and others were able to use their influence to
		  win the guidance and advice of David Masson, Professor of Rhetoric and English
		  Literature, a prominent supporter of the women's cause. By 1873, women were
		  enrolled in Association classes as diverse as Mathematics, Moral Philosophy,
		  Chemistry, Physiology, Botany and Bible Criticism. In 1874 a University
		  Certificate in Arts was introduced, and by 1877 the Rules and Calendar of the
		  Association were being printed in the 
		University Calendar  thus forging the link between the
		University of Edinburgh and the cause of women's education. With a change in
		name (to EAUEW) the Association continued to attract students to its classes,
		and to campaign to obtain a university education for women. In the end, the
		debate produced the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889 which led to the drawing
		up of Regulations for the Graduation of Women and for their instruction in the
		Universities, 1892. In 1893 eight women graduated from the University of
		Edinburgh. They had all been EAUEW students. Right from the start, classes were
		mixed with the exception of medical ones. With its main objective now achieved,
		the EAUEW turned to the provision of facilities and amenities for women. By
		1897, a library and accommodation for women were available at Masson Hall, at
		that time located at George Square, Edinburgh. By 1914 more than a thousand
		women had graduated at the University. The EAUEW was wound up in the 1970s.
