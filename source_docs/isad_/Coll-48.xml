      <p>Alexander Gillon Macalpine was born 11 June 1869 in Linlithgow. He was
		  educated in Linlithgow and at George Watson's College in Edinburgh, then went
		  to Edinburgh University and Glasgow Free Church College. He was ordained in
		  1893. With the exception of 1914-21 when he was Minister of Monquhitter and New
		  Byth, Aberdeenshire, he was a missionary in Nyasaland (Malawi), mainly at
		  Bandawe, Chintechi, and later on Livingstonia. In his earliest years in the
		  country Macalpine did some administrative and postal work. He became the first
		  Clerk of the Synod of the Church of Central Africa Presbyterian. He prepared a
		  dictionary of the Chitonga language, and translated and revised the New
		  Testament in Chitonga. Two manuscript copies of the dictionary are said to be
		  in the libraries of Glasgow and Witwatersrand Universities. Macalpine died in
		  Glasgow, 8 September 1957. The material constituting the Macalpine Malawi
		  missionary papers and linguistic studies, was presented by the Rev. Alexander
		  Gillon Macalpine, jr., in 1964 and 1993, and by Dr. H. B. Auld in 1993. </p>
