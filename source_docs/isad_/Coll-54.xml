      <p>The writer Robert Nye was born 15 March 1939 in London. He attended
		  Southend High School, a traditional grammar school, and began writing when he
		  was thirteen. Between leaving school in 1955 and starting to write full-time in
		  1961, he held a variety of jobs including newspaper reporter, milkman, labourer
		  in a market-garden, and ward orderly in a sanatorium. These jobs supported him
		  in his poetry writing. In 1961, Nye moved to North Wales to absorb himself in
		  full-time writing. Later on he settled in Edinburgh where he lived until 1977,
		  then he moved to Ireland. In 1961, he published his first collection of poems, 
		Juvenilia 1 , and a second volume 
		Juvenilia 2  was published in 1963. Around this time he
		became successful as a reviewer, becoming poetry editor for 
		The Scotsman  in 1967 and poetry critic for the 
		Times  in 1971. In addition to criticism and poetry,
		writing for children provided an outlet, 
		Taliesin  (1966) and 
		March has horse's ears  (1966) being his first books for
		children. These were based on a re-telling of Welsh tales. Other works for
		children, poetry, and short stories followed. Nye has written novels too, 
		Doubtfire  (1967), then 
		Falstaff  (1976), 
		Merlin  (1978) and 
		Faust  (1980). </p>
