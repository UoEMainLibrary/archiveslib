      <p>John Macmurray retired as Professor of Moral Philosophy, University of
		  Edinburgh in 1958. Macmurray was born in Maxwellton, Kirkcudbrightshire,
		  south-west Scotland on 16 February 1891. He was educated at the Grammar School
		  and at Robert Gordon's College in Aberdeen, and then at Glasgow University from
		  which he graduated in 1913. He then went to Balliol College, Oxford, as Snell
		  Exhibitioner and Newlands Scholar, although the First World War interrupted
		  this. His military service lasted between 1914-19, and he served as a Private
		  in the Royal Army Medical Corps from 1914, and as a Lieutenant in the Cameron
		  Highlanders from 1916. He was awarded the Military Cross. From 1919 he held
		  academic posts at the University of Oxford and at the University of Manchester,
		  and in 1921 became Professor of Philosophy in the University of the
		  Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. Between 1922-28 he was back at
		  Balliol College, Oxford, and between 1928-44 was Grote Professor of the
		  Philosophy of Mind and Logic at the University of London. In 1944 until 1958 he
		  was Professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, and also
		  Gifford Lecturer, Glasgow University, 1953-54. Macmurray's publication record
		  spanned some thirty years, from 
		Freedom in the modern world  (1932) to 
		Search for reality in religion  (1965). Professor John
		Macmurray died 21 June 1976. </p>
