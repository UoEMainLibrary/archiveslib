      <p>In 1777 Princess Ekaterina Romanovna Vorontsova Dashkova arrived in
		  Scotland with her son Paul (Pavel Mikhailovich Dashkov). Her son immediately
		  began studies at Edinburgh University, and in 1779 the Princess, still resident
		  in Edinburgh, gave a collection of Russian commemorative medals to mark the
		  occasion of the graduation of Paul as a Master of Arts. The medals, over 150 in
		  number and all made of copper, were entrusted first to Professor John Robison,
		  Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University and a Fellow of the Royal
		  Society of Edinburgh, who was instructed to make a catalogue of them. In the
		  early 1770s, Robison had very briefly held the Chair of Mathematics in the
		  Imperial Naval Cadet Corps at Kronstadt, where he had been given the rank of
		  Colonel. The medals were only handed back to the University after Robison's
		  death in 1805. If a catalogue was ever made by Robison it did not survive, and
		  a proper catalogue of the collection still has to be compiled. </p>
    </bioghist>
    <scopecontent encodinganalog="isadg(2)331">
      <p>Some of the medals show rulers of Russia, military figures, statesmen,
		  events of the reign of Peter the Great. Others mark events such as coronations,
		  accessions, marriages and deaths of Russian rulers. Imperial institutions are
		  commemorated, as are cities and buildings of the Russian empire. </p>
