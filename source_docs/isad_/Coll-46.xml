      <p>The Challenger Expedition of 1872-76 was the first great voyage of
		  oceanographical exploration. In forty-one months from December 1872 to May 1876
		  the wooden steam corvette HMS Challenger visited all the oceans of the world,
		  with the exception of the Arctic. The vessel and crew were provided by the
		  Admiralty, and the naval command was given to Captain (later Sir) George Strong
		  Nares. The scientific staff were supervised by Charles Wyville Thomson
		  (knighted in 1876), a Scottish naturalist and student of marine invertebrates.
		  The expedition was charged to determine deep sea physical conditions including
		  depth, temperature and ocean currents. Charting, surveying, and biological
		  investigations were also carried out. In this programme of oceanographical
		  research , the expedition covered 127,600 kilometres (68,890 nautical miles),
		  gathering observations from 362 stations and making 492 deep soundings and 133
		  dredgings. Thomson had been appointed Professor of Natural History at Edinburgh
		  University in 1870, and much of the preparation for this voyage of
		  oceanographic exploration took place in Edinburgh. At the end of the expedition
		  the Challenger Office was set up there. The 
		Report on the Scientific Results of the Voyage of H.M.S.
		  Challenger  was issued in fifty volumes between 1850 and 1895. When
		Thomson died in 1882, John Murray succeeded him as Director of the Challenger
		Office and editor of the Report. Much of the information gathered by the
		Challenger Expedition is still used today. </p>

      <p>The Challenger Papers contain sheets of plates illustrating various
		  marine life forms, and original drawings of marine life forms; engravings,
		  lithographs, photographs, etc. of marine life forms; drawing and engravings of
		  Challenger equipment; and, statistical material, graphs, charts and maps. There
		  are drawings, engravings and photographs of Challenger personnel at various
		  tasks, and of Challenger and its interiors; and, pictures of people and places
		  (not Challenger personnel), and large and small original drawings, engravings,
		  and photographs. There is also miscellaneous textual material, and engraved
