      <p>The Collection of Early 19th century Broadsides have been pasted into
		  a foolscap minute-book of the West Port Yearly Society. The broadsides are
		  printed, and form a scrapbook of ballads which are not to be found in other
		  collections. All of the broadsides were printed between 1831 and 1835, mostly
		  in Edinburgh, but seven were printed in Reading, England, during the same
		  period. It is unclear why these were included in a clearly Scottish - if not
		  Edinburgh - collection, but it should be noted that some of the seven were
		  unrecorded by the Local Studies Librarian of Reading Public Library until a set
		  of photocopies were sent there. It is also possible that some of the longsheets
		  from which the ballads in the middle section of the volume were cut, were
		  English in origin. It is not clear who assembled the Collection, but the
		  methods employed by the anonymous collector seem dubious. Most of the
		  broadsides have been cropped close to the text thus destroying decorative
		  woodcuts, printers' imprints and, in some cases, original footnotes. In
		  addition, almost all of the manuscript minutes of the West Port yearly Society
		  have been obliterated. </p>

      <p>Many of the works in the Collection of Broadsides lampoon different
		  political figures associated with the Reform Bills, the Burgh Reform Bill, and
		  other pieces of reform legislation of the day. Some are of topical but
		  non-political interest, and many are printings of traditional and literary
		  ballads and songs. </p>
