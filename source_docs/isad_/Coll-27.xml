      <p>The architect Robert Stodart Lorimer, the son of a law professor at
		  Edinburgh University, was born in Edinburgh, 4 November 1864. He was raised in
		  a Georgian townhouse in Edinburgh's New Town and was educated at Edinburgh
		  Academy and Edinburgh University. In 1885 he started his career in architecture
		  with the practice of Sir Robert Rowan Anderson in Edinburgh, and he served
		  there for four and a half years. After travelling in England, he entered the
		  London office of G. F. Bodley, R.A., where he remained for eighteen months
		  before returning to Edinburgh. During his career, Lorimer became interested in
		  the Arts and Crafts Movement and in Scottish Vernacular architecture. These
		  interests led Lorimer to undertake the Thistle Chapel in the High Kirk of St.
		  Giles, Edinburgh, in 1909 (the chapel of the Knights of the Thistle). Over the
		  years he also remodelled suburban villas and built cottages in various parts of
		  the city. Another major project was the Scottish National War Memorial within
		  Edinburgh Castle. He also created similar memorials in Italy, Egypt and in
		  Greece. Towards the end of his career he restored Paisley Abbey. Sir Robert
		  Lorimer died in 1929. </p>

      <p>The Lorimer Papers (office letters) have been sorted and numbered with
		  a full inventory on typed sheets. The Papers relate to projects in Edinburgh
		  and all over Scotland, and elsewhere in the United Kingdom. There are some
		  plans of buildings and building details. Material in some boxes have been
		  sorted but not numbered. Some Papers are still in bundles with only rudimentary
		  sorting. </p>
