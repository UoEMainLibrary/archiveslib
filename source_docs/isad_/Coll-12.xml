      <p>Thomas Charles Hope was born in 1766. He studied at Edinburgh's Royal
		  High School and then Edinburgh University where he graduated in 1787 and
		  published his dissertation 
		Tentamen Inaugurale quaedam de Plantarum Motibus et Vita,
		  complactens . In 1787 too, Hope was appointed Professor of Chemistry at
		Glasgow University then resigned in 1789 when he became Assistant Professor of
		Medicine. In 1795, Hope was elected joint Professor of Chemistry at Edinburgh
		University with Joseph Black (1728-1799), and when Black died he became sole
		Professor. Early in his career, Hope put forward two important pieces of
		research. Firstly, in 1793, before the Royal Society of Edinburgh, he gave 
		An account of a mineral from Strontian, and of a peculiar species
		  of Earth which it contains  - the mineral being strontium carbonate
		discovered at Strontian, Argyllshire. Secondly, he established that water
		attained its maximum density several degrees above the freezing point. Other
		scientific papers included those on the chemical and colouring matters in the
		leaves and flowers of plants. Hope resigned his Professorship during the
		1842-43 session, and died in Edinburgh on 13 June 1844. </p>
