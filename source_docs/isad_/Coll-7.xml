      <p>Andrew Duncan, son of Andrew Duncan the elder (1744-1827), was born in
		  Edinburgh on 10 August 1773. He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh
		  and was apprenticed to the Edinburgh surgeons Alexander and George Wood. He
		  graduated with the degree of M.A. in 1793 and M.D. in 1794. He then studied in
		  London and made visits to medical schools abroad, in Gottingen, Vienna, Pisa
		  and Naples among others. On his return to Edinburgh he became a Fellow of the
		  Royal College of Physicians and a Physician to the Royal Public Dispensary. He
		  then became Physician to the Fever Hospital at Queensberry House. Duncan's
		  travels abroad had shown him the necessity of closer co-operation between the
		  medical profession and the State, particularly with regard to criminal law, and
		  he stressed this point whenever he could. Indeed, in 1807 a Chair of Medical
		  Jurisprudence and Medical Police was set up at Edinburgh University with Duncan
		  as its first Professor. In addition, from 1809 to 1822, he performed the duties
		  of Secretary of the Senatus and Librarian to the University. In 1819 he
		  resigned as Professor of Medical Jurisprudence on being appointed to assist his
		  father in the Chair of the Institutes of Medicine. In 1821, Duncan was elected
		  Professor of Materia Medica at Edinburgh University. His 
		Edinburgh Dispensary  was published in 1803. From 1816
		until his death, Duncan was an active member of the Commission for the
		re-building of the University (the Adam-Playfair buildings of the Old College).
		Andrew Duncan, junior, died on 13 May 1832. </p>
