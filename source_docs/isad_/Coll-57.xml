      <p>Robert Flint was born on 14 March 1838 at Greenburn, Sibbaldie,
		  Dumfriesshire. He was educated at Evan Water and Moffat Schools in the area,
		  and then at the University of Glasgow. He became licensed to preach in 1858 and
		  held successive charges at the East Church of Aberdeen, 1859-62, and at
		  Kilconquhar, 1862-64. In 1864 he was appointed to the Chair of Moral Philosophy
		  and Political Economy in the University of St. Andrews, a post he held till his
		  transference to the Professorship of Divinity in the University of Edinburgh in
		  1876. In 1895 he declined the Moderatorship of the General Assembly of the
		  Church of Scotland. The Professor resigned his Chair at the University in 1903.
		  His scholarly reputation had already been established when he came to
		  Edinburgh. His books and pamphlets exercised a world-wide influence. They
		  included 
		The philosophy of history in France and Germany  (1874), 
		Theism  (1876), 
		Anti-theistic theories  (1879), 
		Socialism  (1894), 
		Hindu pantheism  (1897), and 
		Agnosticism  (1903). He received honorary degrees from the
		Universities of Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow, and from Princeton and Yale.
		Professor Flint died in Edinburgh on 25 November 1910 and was buried at
		Liberton in the city. </p>
