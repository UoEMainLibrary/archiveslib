      <p>The author John Barrington Wain, 1925-1994, was Professor of Poetry at
		  University of Oxford, 1973-78. He was born in Stoke-on-Trent and educated at
		  the High School, Newcastle-under-Lyme, and then St John's College, Oxford,
		  where he became Fereday Fellow, 1946-49. He was a Lecturer in English
		  Literature at the University of Reading, 1947-55, and on resignation became a
		  freelance author and critic. Like contemporary figures, Kingsley Amis, Philip
		  Larkin, and John Braine, Wain began publishing just as Britain was recovering
		  from the Second World War. It was a time when writers were reacting against the
		  orthodoxies of modernism. Wain was one of the Angry Young Men. His fictional
		  works included 
		Hurry on down  (1953); 
		Living in the present  (1955); 
		The contenders  (1958); 
		A travelling woman  (1959); 
		Nuncle and other stories  (1960); 
		Strike the father dead  (1962); 
		The young visitors  (1965); 
		Death of the hind legs and other stories  (1966); 
		The smaller sky  (1967); 
		A winter in the hills  (1970); 
		The Life Guard and other stories  (1971); 
		The pardoner's tale  (1978); 
		Lizzie's floating shop  (1981); 
		Young shoulders  (1982); 
		Where the rivers meet  (1988); 
		Comedies  (1990); 
		Johnson is leaving: a monodrama  (1994); and, 
		Hungry generations  (1994). In addition he wrote poetry
		and plays and also did much work as an editor, critic, biographer, anthologist,
		reviewer and broadcaster. The literary manuscripts of John Barrington Wain were
		deposited in 1974, and subsequently added to by the author until 1986, when the
		whole deposit was purchased by the Library with the help of the Local Museums
		Purchase Fund. These manuscripts constitute MSS 2851-2874. Some items were
		deposited after 1985 and these, along with the manuscripts in the possession of
		the author at his death were purchased in 1996, with the aid of the National
		Fund for Acquisitions. These manuscripts constitute MSS 3124-3137. Further
		manuscripts were found by his family subsequently and were gifted in December
		1997. The manuscript of his first novel, 
		Hurry on Down  (1953), has not survived, but notebooks,
		manuscripts and typescripts of most of his later novels, short stories, poetry,
		plays and criticism are present. </p>
