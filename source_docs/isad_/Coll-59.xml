      <p>The Edinburgh Choral Union was instituted on 25 November 1858 at
		  Wood's Musical Rooms, Waterloo Place, in central Edinburgh. Its first conductor
		  was Charles J. Hargitt, the organist at St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church,
		  Broughton Street. The choir performed before Queen Victoria on her visit to the
		  Edinburgh International Exhibition held on the Meadows in 1886. The title
		  'Royal' was conferred by King George V in 1911. The Edinburgh Royal Choral
		  Union (ERCU) sang before Queen Elizabeth II when Beethoven's 
		9th Symphony  was conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham at the
		opening concert of the 1956 Edinburgh International Festival. Many notable
		soloists have sung with the ERCU since it came into existence, among them Jenny
		Lind (1861), Isobel Baillie, Kathleen Ferrier, Peter Pears, and Dietrich
		Fischer-Dieskau. Over the decades, the ERCU has performed many 'firsts' in
		Scotland, most notably Elgar's 
		Dream of Gerontius  (1903), Bach's 
		Mass in B Minor  (1907), and Britten's 
		War Requiem  (1964). The ERCU is famed for its annual New
		Year's performances of the 
		Messiah , given since 1888, and in modern times usually
		held in the city's Usher Hall. </p>
