      <p>Andrew Brown was born at Biggar, Peeblesshire, in 1763. He was
		  educated at Glasgow University then he entered the Church and was ordained
		  minister of the Scottish Church in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1787. Brown
		  returned to Scotland in 1795 and held charges in Lochmaben and at New
		  Greyfriars and Old St. Giles' in Edinburgh. In 1801 he became Regius Professor
		  of Rhetoric and Belles-Lettres at Edinburgh University, a post first offered to
		  Sir Walter Scott who turned it down. His appointment proved to be a disaster
		  however, for he was more interested in North American history than in
		  literature and during his term of office the subject he was appointed to teach
		  declined. He made no literary contribution and as a lecturer he was uninspired.
		  Professor Andrew Brown died in 1834. </p>
