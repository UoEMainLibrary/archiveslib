      <p>David Bayne Horn was born on 9 July 1901. He was educated at Edinburgh
		  Institution, later called Melville College (now Stewart's Daniel &amp;amp;
		  Melville College). He then studied at Edinburgh University, gaining a first
		  class honours degree in history, MA, 1922. In 1923, Horn joined the staff of
		  the History Department of the University as an Assistant in History. In 1927 he
		  became a Lecturer in History, and in 1929 was awarded the degree of D.Litt. at
		  the University for his thesis on 
		Sir Charles Hanbury Williams and European diplomacy . Horn
		then went on to become Professor of Modern History in 1954. A writer as well as
		a lecturer, his main interest lay in the field of 18th century diplomatic
		history and 18th century British foreign policy in particular. His publication
		record includes 
		A history of Europe, 1871-1920  (1927), 
		British diplomatic representatives, 1689-1789  (1932), 
		Scottish diplomatists, 1689-1789  (1944), 
		British public opinion and the first partition of Poland 
		(1945), 
		British diplomatic service, 1689-1789 (1961), Frederick the Great
		  and the rise of Prussia  (1964), 
		Great Britain and Europe in the eighteenth century 
		(1967). At the time of his death on 7 August 1969, Horn was engaged in writing
		a full-length history of the University, having been given two years' leave of
		absence for the project. In 1967 he had written a shorter history of the
		University. </p>

      <p>The Papers of Professor Horn are a boxed, unnumbered, uncatalogued
		  collection of papers, drafts, notes, and miscellaneous items. The most
		  significant material relates to the proposed 'long history' of the University.
		  Also included are background materials (drafts, notes, bibliographies,
		  offprints, etc.) relating to Horn's publications on 18th century British
		  diplomatic history: 
		The British diplomatic service, 1689-1789  (1961); 
		Great Britain and Europe in the eighteenth century 
		(1967). There are also packets containing handwritten notes, maps, technical
		data, clippings, photos and offprints relating to Scottish mountains and
		climbing; various lecture notes, correspondence, bronze award medals, and loose
		papers. </p>
