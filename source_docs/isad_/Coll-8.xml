      <p>Isaac Bayley Balfour was born in Edinburgh on 31 March 1853. He was
		  the son of the Professor of Botany at Edinburgh University, John Hutton Balfour
		  (1808-1884). Balfour was educated at Edinburgh Academy and then he studied at
		  Edinburgh University where he was awarded the degrees of B.Sc. in 1873, and
		  D.Sc. in 1875. He also studied abroad at Strasbourg and Wurzburg. He
		  participated in expeditions to Rodriguez in 1874, Socotra in 1880, and Japan
		  and China in 1909-1910. Balfour was Regius Professor of Botany at Glasgow
		  University between 1879 and 1884, then Sherardian Professor of Botany at the
		  University of Oxford, and Fellow of Magdalen College, from 1884 to 1888. From
		  1888, he was Professor of Botany at Edinburgh University, Regius Keeper of the
		  Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh, and the King's Botanist in Scotland. During
		  his Keepership of the Garden, the whole establishment underwent
		  re-organisation, buildings and gardens. He was knighted in 1920. Sir Isaac
		  Bayley Balfour died at Haslemere on 30 November 1922. </p>
