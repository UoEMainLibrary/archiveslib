      <p>The Edinburgh Geological Society was formed in 1834. It was born out
		  of a meeting of eleven members of a class in mineralogy conducted by Mr
		  Alexander Rose. The meeting was held on Thursday 4 December 1834 in Robertson's
		  Tavern, Milne's Close, in the city, where the decision was taken to start a
		  society for "Discussion and Mutual Instruction". The society was to
		  meet in Mr Rose's house at 2 Drummond Street, and was to be known as the
		  Geological Society. Its first President was John Castle, and its first
		  Secretary, James Brodie. Both were members of Mr Rose's class. The first
		  scientific meeting of the Society was held on 8 December 1834, and the subject
		  for discussion being whether or not Arthur's Seat (a hill in the city's
		  Holyrood Park) was of volcanic origin. In 1863, the Society elected Sir
		  Roderick Impey Murchison as its first Patron (1863-71), and he was followed by
		  Sir Charles Lyell (1871-75). While today the Edinburgh Geological Society draws
		  on the considerable geological expertise of the Grant Institute (the Department
		  of Geology and Geophysics, University of Edinburgh) and the British Geological
		  Survey (at Murchison House), it welcomes and encourages amateur and
		  professional alike to become involved in its lectures and excursions. The
		  primary requirement for membership is an interest in geology. The Society has
		  acquired such prestige that there is little difficulty in attracting high
		  calibre speakers on a wide variety of subjects. Lecture meetings are held
		  throughout the winter in the Grant Institute (Kings Buildings site). In the
		  summer, a varied programme of excursions is organised. The Society publishes 
		The Edinburgh Geologist  once or twice a year. This
		publication consists of short papers on a wide range of geological topics with
		descriptions of geological localities. </p>
