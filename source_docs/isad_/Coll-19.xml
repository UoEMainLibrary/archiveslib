      <p>Between 1895 and 1906, John Maitland Thomson was Curator of the
		  Historical Department at HM General Register House, the Scottish Records
		  Office, in Edinburgh (this title later becoming Curator of Historical Records,
		  and then Deputy Keeper of the Records). In 1903 he received an honorary LLD -
		  Doctor of Laws - from Edinburgh University. Thomson was actively publishing and
		  editing between 1904 and 1922. He was involved as an editor in the
		  multi-volumed 
		Registrum magni sigilli regum Scotorum  (1904) - 
		Register of the Great Seal  - succeeding Sir James Balfour
		Paul. He published the 
		Charters, bulls and other documents relating to the Abbey of
		  Inchaffray, chiefly from the originals in the charter chest of the Earl of
		  Kinnoull  (1908), as well as 
		The bishops of Scotland: being notes on the lives of all bishops,
		  under each of the sees, prior to the Reformation  (1912). He was also
		responsible for 
		The public records of Scotland  (1922). John Maitland
		Thomson died in 1923 when out walking in the Pentland Hills, near Edinburgh.
