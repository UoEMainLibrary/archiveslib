      <p>While this manuscript collection is known as The Angus Fraser
		  Manuscript, the content is the work of two individuals, Simon Fraser of Knockie
		  in the parish of Abertarff, born 1773, and Angus Fraser his son, born perhaps
		  1800 in Inverness. An illegitimate child, Angus used his father's surname from
		  around the age of fourteen when he joined the army, in Edinburgh, in 1814. His
		  military career lasted some 31 years, much of it served with the 1st Royal
		  Scots from 1832. His highest rank was Colour Sergeant. Although he learned
		  several tunes as a child, it was during the period with the Royal Scots that he
		  became interested in music and acquired his theoretical knowledge. He
		  discharged from the army, with a pension, in 1845, and returned to Inverness
		  living at the family home at 25 Rose Street. The father, Captain Simon Fraser,
		  died in Inverness in 1852, while Angus Fraser died on 4 February 1870. The
		  collection of music was probably begun during Angus Fraser's army career, but
		  it was in retirement that the manuscript reached its final form. Because of the
		  inheritance of musical and literary material from the elder Fraser, some of the
		  airs in the Angus Fraser Manuscript are dated as early as 1820. The notes to
		  the manuscript collection were written in 1858. Although some Highland airs
		  were published, 
		Knockie (1874), the history of the collection is obscure
		until "rediscovery" by a member of Edinburgh University Library staff in an
		Edinburgh bookshop in the 1950s. It was presented to the Library.</p>

      <p>The Angus Fraser Music Manuscript consists of three named collections
		  intended for publication, a series of sets of variations mostly on well-known
		  airs, and a variety of less-organised manuscript pages. The differing interests
		  of Simon Fraser and Angus Fraser are reflected in the Manuscript. </p>
