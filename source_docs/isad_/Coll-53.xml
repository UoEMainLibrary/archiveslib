      <p>George Ballingall, who was Regius Professor of Military Surgery at the
		  University of Edinburgh, was born on 2 May 1780 in Forglen, Banffshire, where
		  his father was a minister. He attended four literary sessions at the University
		  of St. Andrews before following a course of medical study at the University of
		  Edinburgh between 1803 and 1806, and received his diploma from the Royal
		  College of Surgeons, Edinburgh, on 17 December 1805. Ballingall was then
		  appointed as Assistant Surgeon to the 2nd Battalion 1st Royals. He served in
		  India, witnessed the capture of Java in 1811, and was in occupied Paris in
		  1815. In November 1815 he was appointed Surgeon to the 33rd Regiment of Foot,
		  retiring in 1818. He had also re-matriculated in 1816 to study Chemistry and
		  Military Surgery, and formally graduated in 1819. His M.D. thesis 
		De Apoplexia Sanguinea  was completed at the University
		that year. In 1823, Ballingall became Lecturer on Military Surgery at the
		University, and in 1825 he succeeded to the Chair of Military Surgery. During
		his period of tenure Ballingall fervently sought to impress upon the political
		authorities of the day the necessity of teaching Military Surgery as a separate
		discipline, and to establish similar chairs or lectureships in London and
		Dublin. He also took a keen interest in the running of the Army Medical
		Department, particularly during the disastrous years of the Crimean War. Most
		notable amongst his published works are 
		Practical observations on fever, dysentery, and liver complaints,
		  as they occur amongst the European troops in India: to which is annexed, an
		  essay on syphilis  (1823), 
		The life of Dr. Barclay  (circa 1827), 
		Outlines of military surgery , first published as 
		Outlines of the course of lectures on military surgery 
		(1833), and 
		Observations on the site and construction of hospitals 
		(1851). Ballingall was knighted on the occasion of the accession of King
		William IV. He died at Blairgowrie on 4 December 1855. </p>

      <p>The Sir George Ballingall material is composed of correspondence and
		  papers, 1801-1855. In March 1995, when researching in Edinburgh University
		  Library, Dr. Roger Cooter of the Wellcome Unit for the History of Medicine, in
		  Manchester, dictated the papers onto tape and produced transcripts of about 70
		  per cent of the documents, following the order in which they had been placed in
		  the original boxes. The transcripts, produced in haste, and which may not be
		  accurate in detail, have been placed in MS 3082/11. Otherwise, Ballingall's
		  correspondence is arranged alphabetically and by sender or recipient, then
		  chronologically (in MS 3082/1-2). It mainly concerns his own course, books, and
		  income; chairs of military surgery in London and Dublin; and, military medical
		  matters, especially with reference to the Crimean War. Other material includes
		  memorials, testimonials, and items relating to military surgery (MS 3082/3-10);
		  Dr. Roger Cooter's 1995 transcripts (MS 3082/11); and, the original boxes (MS
		  3083). </p>
