		<head>Administrative/Biographical History</head> 
		<p>Edinburgh Indian Association was formed in 1883 and comprised 6
		  members. Its main function was to serve the social and cultural needs of Indian
		  students attending the University of Edinburgh. By the beginning of the 20th
		  century there were over 200 members. Premises at 11 George Square were leased
		  following a fundraising drive in in 1907. These contained a debating hall,
		  dining hall, library and billiard room.</p> 
		<p>The redevelopment of George Square in the 1960s saw the end of No. 11.
		  This combined with a marked reduction in Indian students saw a decline in the
		  Association but it found a new role in the 1970s as an organisation for Indians
		  who had settled here. By its centenary in 1983, it was also promoting ethnic
		  arts in Scotland. </p>
