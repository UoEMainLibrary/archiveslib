		  the responsibility for professional training of teachers in Scotland was
		  transferred to the National Committee for the Training of Teachers. This

		<p>The Training College was the only institution in Scotland where women
		  desiring to teach in other than elementary schools could receive a training
		  specially arranged to qualify them for work. Students attended lectures at the
		  University of Edinburgh, and after

		  four year concurrent course, and was combined with practical training taken at
		  either Moray House or St. George's.</p> 
		<p>The College was run by a Principal, the first being Miss M.R. Walker (

		  <p>Collection consists of a series of files and loose correspondence, a
			 mixture of student records, Scottish Education Department forms, prospectuses
			 etc. No formal arrangement could be discerned, although there was some rough
			 date order within the various bundles. Due to time constraints and the lack of
			 any formal arrangement, it was decided to keep the bundles intact and arrange
			 by date. This allows the variety of records featuring the same students to be
			 kept together. A detailed list of records common to all bundles is provided, as
			 well as some item level information at bundle level. Researchers are advised to
			 check both the year in which the course was started and completed.</p>
