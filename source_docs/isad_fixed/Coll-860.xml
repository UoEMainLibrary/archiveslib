He was educated in Glasgow and studied for the ministry at Glasgow University, matriculating in 1791. On completion of his theological studies in 1800 he became a Congregationalist. The power of his preaching was noticed and his friends opened a chapel for him in Glasgow in 1803, in North Albion Street. A new and larger chapel was opened in 1819, in West George Street. Earlier, in 1811, Wardlaw became Professor of Systematic Theology at the Congregationalists' Glasgow Theological College. His publications include <title>Essay on Lancaster's improvements in education</title> (1810), <title>Essay on benevolent associations for the poor</title> (1817), and <title>Christian ethics</title> (1832).
