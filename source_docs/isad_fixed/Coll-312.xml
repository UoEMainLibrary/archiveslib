He studied for the medical profession and was awarded his degree in Edinburgh 1783. He first took a post as a surgeon on board a man-of-war but in 1794 he entered the service of the East India Company as a surgeon and medical officer in Bengal. While in India performing his duties he devoted himself to agricultural, botanical, cultural, historical, and other research in Ava, Pegu, the Andaman Islands, the mouth of the Brahmaputra, Mysore, Canara, and Malabar. In addition to duties in southern India, he visited Nepal in 1802. On his return from the mountain kingdom, Buchanan was appointed surgeon to the Governor-General of India, Lord Wellesley (later the Duke of Wellington), and he accompanied Wellesley to England in 1806. Shortly after this he was given the task of carrying out a statistical survey for the East India Company in Bengal which he worked on until 1813. In 1814, Buchanan was appointed Superintendent of the Botanical Gardens in Calcutta and in 1815 he returned to Britain, spending his latter years mainly in Scotland on his Bardowie estate. Buchanan published <title>A journey from Madras through the countries of Mysore, Canara, and Malabar</title> (1807), as well as a description of the fish in the Brahmaputra (1822), and a <title>A history of Nepal</title>.
