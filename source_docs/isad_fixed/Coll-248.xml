He was educated at the academies in Glasgow, Forfar and Dumfries and then studied at Edinburgh University where he was awarded the degree of M.A. in 1882. Barrie served as a journalist on the staff of the <title>Nottingham Journal</title> for a year and a half before returning to Kirriemuir to write sketches of Scottish life for the <title>St James's Gazette</title> and the <title>Cornhill Magazine</title>. The semi-fictional tales were set in Thrums (Kirriemuir to all intents and purposes). In 1885, he moved to London where he wrote for numerous magazines and journals, and his first novel <title>Better dead</title> was written in 1886, followed by <title>When a man's single</title> in 1888. Other work at this time included <title>Auld licht idylls</title>, <title>A window in Thrums</title> (1889), <title>The little minister</title> (1891), and the biographical <title>Margaret Ogilvy</title> (1896). By the turn of the century, Barrie had begun concentrating on writing plays, and he was very successful in this with a stage production of <title>The little minister</title> and with <title>The wedding seat</title> (1897), <title>Quality Street</title> (1901), and <title>The admirable Crichton</title> (1902). Barrie is most renowned however as the creator of <title>Peter Pan, or, the Boy who wouldn't grow up</title> (1904) which had been written for the children of the Llewelyn Davies family. Later work included <title>A kiss for Cinderella</title> (1916), <title>Mary Rose</title> (1920), and <title>The boy David</title> (1936). Barrie became a Baronet in 1913 and received the Order of Merit in 1922. He was Chancellor of Edinburgh University from 1930 to 1937. Sir James Matthew Barrie died on 19 June 1937.</p> </bioghist> <!-- corrected bioghist added by paddy march 19 2002 --> <scopecontent> <p>The collection consists of correspondence, including: letter to Iwym, the illustrator of <title>Martha Spreull</title> at Gen. 1730/1; letters to Sir W.
