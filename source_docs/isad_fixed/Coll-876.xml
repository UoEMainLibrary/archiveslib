As the 8th Marquis of Huntly, Gordon entered the 35th Foot Regiment under his brother-in-law Colonel Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond. He then raised an independent Foot Regiment, served with the 42nd Highlanders, and then was appointed to the 3rd Foot Guards, serving in Flanders. On his return to Scotland he raised a regiment on the Gordon estates which was inspected in Aberdeen in 1794 - the 100th Gordon Highlanders Regiment of Foot, or the Gordon Highlanders. He served with his regiment in Gibraltar and Corunna, then in Corsica, Wexford, and the Netherlands. In 1809 he commanded a division of Lord Chatham's army in the Walcheren Expedition. In 1820 he was made a Knight Grand Cross (G.C.B.)., and in 1827 he succeeded to the Dukedom of Gordon on the death of his father Alexander (1745-1827), 4th Duke of Gordon. That same year he became Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland, and Governor of Edinburgh Castle. Gordon was Captain-General of the Royal Scottish Archers, Chancellor of Marischal College, Aberdeen, Hereditary Keeper of Inverness Castle, and Grand Master of the Orangemen of Scotland. The 5th Duke married Elizabeth, daughter of Alexander Brodie of Arnhill, on 11 December 1813. George Gordon, 5th Duke of Gordon, resided chiefly at Gordon castle, Banffshire, but died at his London residence in Belgrave Square on 28 May 1836.</p> <p>The Duke had died without issue and his brother had predeceased him and so the Dukedom became extinct. Gordon Castle and its large estates passed to Charles (1791-1860), 5th Duke of Richmond and Lennox, who took the additional surname of Gordon. The Dukedom of Gordon was revived by his son, Charles Henry (1818-1903), 6th Duke of Richmond and Lennox, and 1st Duke of Gordon.</p> </bioghist> <scopecontent> <p>The material is composed of: letter to Dr. Roe regretting he is not able to vote in his favour, 1821; letter to Major Sparks congratulating him on promotion, 1836; letter to Sir Patrick Walker about the funeral of King William IV, 1835; letter presenting 'compliments to Messrs.
