After his education, he became a 'reading boy' in a printing-office. Showing a talent for drawing he was apprenticed at the age of fourteen to Gavin Beugo, a heraldic and decorative painter in Edinburgh. David Roberts (1796-1864) who became a life-long friend of Hay was a fellow-apprentice. His spare time was spent developing skills in higher art, particularly the painting of animals, and he attracted the attention of Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832). Scott recommended that he approach decorative art and house-painting as a profession, and employed him in the decoration of his home at Abbotsford in the Scottish Borders along with George Nicholson and William Nicholson (1781-1844). Around 1828, Hay started his own business in Edinburgh's George Street and became a successful house decorator, winning many public works commissions including the hall of the Society of Arts, London. He was a member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and also a founder of the Aesthetic Society established in Edinburgh in 1851. Hay's publications on art include <title>The laws of harmonious colouring adapted to house painting</title> (1828), <title>Proportion, or the Geometric principle of beauty analysed</title> (1843), <title>The principles of beauty in colour systematized</title> (1845), and <title>The geometric beauty of the human figure defined</title> (1851). David Ramsay Hay died in Edinburgh on 10 September 1866.</p> </bioghist> <scopecontent> <p>The collection includes the unbound papers of <title>Abstract of an inquiry into the geometrical principles which determine the typical relative position of the more important points in the skeleton and on the surface of the human body</title>, a volume of circa 80 letters between 1840 and 1859, and circa 109 letters from members various correspondents including members of the Aesthetic Society 1849 to 1863.</p> </scopecontent> <accessrestrict> <p>Generally open for consultation to bona fide researchers, but please contact repository for details in advance.</p> </accessrestrict> <note> <p>The biographical/administrative history was compiled using the following material: (1) Stephen, Leslie. and Lee, Sidney (eds.). <title>Dictionary of national biography</title>.
