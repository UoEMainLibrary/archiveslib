He studied at Edinburgh University, graduating in July 1687. Hart became Minister of Ratho, just west of Edinburgh, in July 1692, and then Minister at Greyfriar's Church in the city in 1702. He strongly opposed the 1707 Union of the Scottish and English parliaments, and from the pulpit denounced statesman William Carstares (1649-1715) - a predecessor of Hart's at Greyfriar's - as an enemy to his country and a traitor to the church. After the Union had been effected out however, he became reconciled to the new state of political affairs and was chosen by the General Assembly as a Commissioner of the Church of Scotland - with Carstares and others - to congratulate George I on his accession to the throne in 1714. He was nominated by George to the post of King's Almoner in 1726. Hart's published works include <title>The qualifications of rulers and the duty of subjects described</title> (1703), and, edited in 1832, <title>The journal of Mr. James Hart in 1714</title>.
