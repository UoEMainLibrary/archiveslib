He was the second son of Sir David Hume (or Home), 7th Baron of Wedderburn, Berwickshire. He was educated in Dunbar and studied at St. Andrews before going to France, Geneva, and Italy. He returned in 1581 to manage the affairs of his brother who had fallen ill. By 1583 he had become the private secretary of his relative Archibald Douglas, 8th Earl of Angus (1555-1588), and actively interested himself in the Earl, his family, and his cause. A series of his letters became the <title>History of the Houses of Douglas and Angus</title> the subject of which was the doctrine of obedience to princes. Hume's other publications include <title>De unione insulae Britanniae</title> (1605), <title>Cambdenia; id est, Examen nonnullorum a Gulielmo Cambreno in 'Britannia' sua positorum: praecipue quae ad irrisionem Scoticae gentis pertinent et eorum ac Pictorum originem</title> (1617), <title>History of the House of Wedderburn</title> (1611), and <title>Apologia Basilica; seu Machiavelli ingenium examinatum, in libro quem inscripsit princeps</title> (1626). When young he also wrote Latin poems including <title>Daphn-Amaryllis</title> at the age of fourteen, <title>Lusus poetici</title> (1605), <title>Henrici principis justa</title> on the death of Prince Henry, and <title>Regi suo gratulatio</title> to welcome back King James VI to Scotland in 1617. In his later years, much of his writing was done at his property of Gowkscroft, renamed Godscroft, in Berwickshire. David Hume of Godscroft is believed to have died in 1630. </p> </bioghist> <scopecontent> <p>The material includes: <title>Cambdenia; id est, Examen nonnullorum a Gulielmo Cambreno in 'Britannia' sua positorum: praecipue quae ad irrisionem Scoticae gentis pertinent et eorum ac Pictorum originem</title>; and, two copies of <title>De unione insulae Britanniae tractatus secundus</title>.</p> </scopecontent> <accruals> <p>Check the local Indexes for details of any additions.</p> </accruals> <accessrestrict> <p>Generally open for consultation to bona fide researchers, but please contact repository for details in advance.</p> </accessrestrict> <note> <p>The biographical/administrative history was compiled using the following material: (1) Lee, Sidney (ed.). <title>Dictionary of national biography</title>.
