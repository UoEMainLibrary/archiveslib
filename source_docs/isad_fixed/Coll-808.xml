The firms include insurance companies, animal feed firms, and repair shops. There are accounts from an ironmonger and sheet metal worker in Portobello, the King Oil Company of Cambuslang, McVitie and Price for pig food, and Alexander of Edinburgh, dealers in Lincoln, Ford and Fordson vehicles, and suppliers to Brunstane Farm of a Fordson tractor costing Pounds 100 in 1949. There is also an accounts book covering the period 1932 to 1938, and a small empty account book of Park in account with W. J. Hunter, Butcher and Poulterer, 278 High Street, Portobello.</p> </scopecontent> <accruals> <p>Check the local Indexes for details of any additions.</p> </accruals> <accessrestrict> <p>Generally open for consultation to bona fide researchers, but please contact repository for details in advance.</p> </accessrestrict> <note> <p>The biographical/administrative history was compiled using material contained in the collection.</p> </note> <otherfindaid> <p>Important finding aids generally are: the alphabetical Index to Manuscripts held at Edinburgh University Library, Special Collections and Archives, consisting of typed slips in sheaf binders and to which additions were made until 1987; and the Index to Accessions Since 1987. </p> </otherfindaid> <!-- control access terms --> <controlaccess> <subject source="lcsh"> <emph altrender="a">Agriculture</emph> </subject> <persname source="ncarules"> <emph altrender="surname">Park</emph> <emph altrender="forename">M.</emph> <emph altrender="dates">fl 1932-1973</emph> <emph altrender="epithet">Farmer</emph> </persname> <persname source="ncarules"> <emph altrender="surname">Park</emph> <emph altrender="forename"> J.</emph> <emph altrender="dates">fl 1932-1973</emph> <emph altrender="epithet">Farmer</emph> </persname> <corpname> <emph altrender="a">Brunstane Farm, Portobello (Edinburgh, Scotland)</emph> </corpname> <geogname> <emph altrender="a">Scotland</emph> <emph altrender="x">Economic conditions</emph> </geogname> </controlaccess> </archdesc>
