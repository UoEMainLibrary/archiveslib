At the age of ten he was apprenticed to a printing firm and later worked with the city firm of Ballantynes. He showed an early liking for music which he was able to study, and he sang in church choirs in Edinburgh. He began to devote himself entirely to the teaching of music and to giving concerts, and he studied singing in Edinburgh and in London. In 1830 he appeared in the opera <title>Guy Mannering</title> and in other work at Covent Garden and Drury Lane. He then directed himself towards Scottish song and he appeared before Queen Victoria at Taymouth Castle in 1842. He also took his Scottish entertainment to North America and John Wilson died in Quebec, Canada, on 8 July 1849.</p> </bioghist> <scopecontent> <p>The material is composed of: a letter from Wilson to William Dixon, Milton of Aberfoyle, near Doune, Perthshire, 1840, and is concerned with money matters; a letter from Gower Street from Wilson to 'My dear sir' apologising for not coming 'this evening, for I have been seized with such a hoarseness that I cannot attempt to sing or even speak'; and, a signed fragment.</p> </scopecontent> <accruals> <p>Check the local Indexes for details of any additions.</p> </accruals> <accessrestrict> <p>Generally open for consultation to bona fide researchers, but please contact repository for details in advance.</p> </accessrestrict> <note> <p>The biographical/administrative history was compiled using the following material: (1) Lee, Stephen (ed.). <title>Dictionary of national biography</title>.
