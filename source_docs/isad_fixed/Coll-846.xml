He was sent to the Moravian school (the Moravians are a religious community) at Fulneck, near Leeds, and while there began writing poetry. Work followed in a bakery and then in a store, and then to the offices of the <title>Sheffield Register</title>. Facing prosecution, the proprietor and editor of the journal - a reformer - escaped to America, and Montgomery became the working editor and then the owner of the title which he changed to the <title>Sheffield Iris</title>. He too faced prosecution over his publishing content and he spent time in York Castle prison for describing a Sheffield riot in 1795. Poetry rather than journalism was his forte however and his work included <title>The ocean</title> (1805), <title>The common lot</title> (1805), <title>The wanderer of Switzerland</title> (1806), <title>The West Indies</title> (1809), <title>The world before the flood</title> (1812), <title>Greenland</title> (1819) and <title>The pelican island</title> (1827). James Montgomery died on 30 April 1854.</p> </bioghist> <scopecontent> <p>The collection is composed of: an original hymn, dated Edinburgh, 25 October 1841, entitled <title>The Christian graces</title>; and, a covering letter addressed to Robert Scott Moncrieff, Dalkeith. </p> </scopecontent> <acqinfo> <p>Among miscellaneous letters, purchased E.
