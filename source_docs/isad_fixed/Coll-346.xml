The classes of surgeon anatomist Robert Knox were particularly popular. At the request of the Royal College of Surgeons, one executed criminal was allocated to the anatomists each year but this proved to be insufficient to meet study demands and resulted in the trade of body snatching carried out by resurrectionists. Some graveyards in Edinburgh were encircled by walls, railings and watchtowers to keep the body-snatchers out, and graves themselves were often protected by their own railings, gates and locks. It was against this background that in 1828 Burke and Hare carried out their murders to supply the demand. </p> </bioghist> <scopecontent> <p>The papers are composed of the minutes of evidence in the Ramshorn 'resurrectionist' trial (Ramshorn Churchyard, Glasgow), 1814, and an account of a grave-robbing expedition by medical students in 1830 probably in S. E. England and entitled <title>Twenty four hours of my pupillage</title>.</p> </scopecontent> <acqinfo> <p>Minutes of evidence, acquired 1960, Accession no. E60.18.

Edinburgh University Library holds other papers relating to the surgeon and anatomist Robert Knox (Check local Indexes for details) whose reputation was sullied through his association with Burke and Hare who murdered in order to supply Knox with cadavers.
