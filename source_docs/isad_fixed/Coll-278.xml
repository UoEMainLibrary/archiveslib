He was educated in Glasgow, but on the death of his father the Duchess of Hamilton became his patron and wished him to study law. Alston however wanted to study medicine and went to Leyden to study under Hermann Boerhaave (1668-1738). In Leyden, he met Dr. Alexander Monro, primus (1697-1767). On their return to Edinburgh they revived medical lectures at the University with Alston being appointed Lecturer in Botany and Materia Medica. He also became Superintendent of the Botanic Garden. Alston published various medical papers and an index to the plants in the Botanic Garden in Edinburgh. In his <title>Tirocinium Botanicum Edinburgense</title> (1753), he attacked the Linnaean system of classification. Charles Alston died on 22 November 1760. </p> </bioghist> <scopecontent> <p>The collection of Charles Alson includes; a history of drugs, or materia medica, from his lectures, at Dc.8.58; a treatise on materia medica, 1733, at Gen. 695-697D; an introduction to the materia medica and an introduction to botany, 1736, at Dc.8.12; lectures on materia medica and 'methodus praescribendi', 24 April 1736, at Dk.7.1; lectures on the materia medica and lectures on botany, 1739-1740, at MSS 2624-2625; and, observations on materia medica collected from Alston's lectures, 1754, at Dk.5.12.
