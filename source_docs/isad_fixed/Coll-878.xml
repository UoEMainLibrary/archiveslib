Campbell was a Scottish novelist.</p> </bioghist> <scopecontent> <p>The collection is composed of letters to Mr. M. Starr from Campbell, at Upper Montagu Street, London W.1. One is headed Thursday and tells of him wanting to come to Combe Martin and that he is 'working at a great rate just now' as he has to deliver a new book to his publisher. Another is headed Sunday and tells how 'work has consumed' all his time. It also refers to Milo sailing to America and that if Milo wants to use the flat he must say in advance so that the cook can expect him. The letter also refers to days spent at East Challacombe. A third letter is headed July 16 and tells of a new book not yet finished but that the 'publishers are being more than charming about it'.</p> </scopecontent> <accruals> <p>Check the local Indexes for details of any additions.</p> </accruals> <accessrestrict> <p>Generally open for consultation to bona fide researchers, but please contact repository for details in advance.</p> </accessrestrict> <note> <p>The biographical/administrative history was compiled using material contained in the collection.</p> </note> <otherfindaid> <p>Important finding aids generally are: the alphabetical Index to Manuscripts held at Edinburgh University Library, Special Collections and Archives, consisting of typed slips in sheaf binders and to which additions were made until 1987; and the Index to Accessions Since 1987. </p> </otherfindaid> <!-- control access terms --> <controlaccess> <subject source="lcsh"> <emph altrender="a">Authors and publishers</emph> </subject> <persname source="ncarules"> <emph altrender="surname">Campbell</emph> <emph altrender="forename">C J</emph> <emph altrender="dates">fl 1925</emph> <emph altrender="epithet">Novelist</emph> </persname> </controlaccess> </archdesc>
