The term portolan (from the Italian 'portolano') refers to written sailing directions for seafarers. By networks of lines indicating the direction of one port from another, navigators were able to set their necessary courses. From such works, accumulated over generations, the first marine charts were drawn. Now the charts are admired as much for their decorations as their historical information. This particular small collection is composed of charts drawn by Franciscus Oliva, one of a well-known family of Italian map-makers, in Marseille in 1650. Most portolan charts of the Mediterranean were compiled in Genoa, Venice, and Majorca.</p> </bioghist> <scopecontent> <p>The charts are of the Aegean Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, and the coasts of Western Europe and North-western Africa.</p> </scopecontent> <custodhist> <p>Gift of Baillie Thomas Young, Edinburgh, 1690.</p> </custodhist> <accruals> <p>Check the local Indexes for details of any additions.</p> </accruals> <accessrestrict> <p>Generally open for consultation to bona fide researchers, but please contact repository for details in advance.</p> </accessrestrict> <note> <p>The biographical/administrative history was compiled using the following material: (1) <title>The new encyclopaedia Britannica</title>.
