		  <p>David Brewster (<date normal="1781/1868"
			 type="life-span">1781-1868</date>) was an eminent physicist, university
			 principal and prolific writer of scientific literature. Concentrating on the
			 science of optics, Brewster made significant discoveries about polarisation of
			 light and absorption spectra, invented the kaleidoscope and developed the
			 stereoscope. Born in Jedburgh, Scotland, Brewster was a devout evangelical
			 protestant who trained initially in theology. Though a succesful preacher in
			 the Church of Scotland, his phobia of public speaking curtailed his involvement
			 in the church. However, his faith continued to play an important role in his
			 life, and his support for the Free Church of Scotland in 
			 <date normal="1843" type="single">1843</date> nearly led to his
			 dismissal from the University of Edinburgh. His religious faith is also thought
			 to have played a part in his scepticism about the wave theory of light.</p> 
		  <p>In his lifetime, he published an impressive 315 scientific papers
			 and articles, mostly on his pet subject of optics. His experiments in
			 polarisation, which represent the bulk of his work, investigated in particular
			 the different forms of polarisation that occur when light is reflected or
			 refracted by various materials. Brewster's investigations of spectra included
			 analysis of Newton's theory of colours and experiments on the absorption
			 spectra shown in light shone through gases, and the similar lines seen in the
			 sun's spectrum. He never abandoned the emission theory of light, and never
			 accepted as true the theory that light was a wave - he preferred to see this as
			 a convenient tool for calculation.</p> 
		  <p>Brewster's invention of the kaleidoscope, popular as the instrument
			 was, brought him little pecuniary benefit because of a botched patent
			 application that left the design unprotected from unauthorised reproduction. He
			 had a keen interest in photography from its infancy, and though he wrote about
			 it and received a medal from the Photographic Society of Paris in 
			 <date normal="1865" type="single">1865</date>, he never found time to
			 experiment properly with the chemistry of light. Brewster also promoted the use
			 of the Fresnel lens in lighthouses, and oversaw a series of succesful
			 experiments with these in 
			 <date normal="1833" type="single">1833</date>. Brewster's finances
			 were improved in his later life by his appointment by the crown as principal of
			 the United Colleges of St. Salvator and St. Leonard in St. Andrews in 
			 <date normal="1837" type="appointmentdate">1837</date>, and his
			 subsequent election by Edinburgh town council to the principalship of the
			 University of Edinburgh in 
			 <date normal="1859" type="appointmentdate">1859</date>, a post he
			 held until his death in 
			 <date normal="1868" type="death">1868</date>. Brewster was also a
			 founder member of the British Association for the Advancement of Science and a
			 keen, active participant in it.</p>
