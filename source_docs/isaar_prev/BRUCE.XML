		  <p>William Speirs Bruce (<date type="lifespan"
			 normal="1867/1921">1867-1921</date>) led the Scottish National Antarctic
			 Expedition of 
			 <date type="inclusive" normal="1902/1904">1902-1904</date>, along
			 with many other scientific expeditions to both Polar Regions of the world.
			 Bruce studied at Norfolk County School, before reading medicine at the
			 University of Edinburgh, but gave up his studies in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1892">1892</date>, before he qualified as
			 a doctor, in order to take part in a whaling expedition to the oceans
			 surrounding the Falklands. Though he was, officially, ship's surgeon, he spent
			 most of his time sealing and making 2-hourly meteorological observations over a
			 3-month period - the evidence gained in these observations of the weather
			 giving the first ever evidence of the Antarctic anticyclone. </p> 
		  <p>For several years, Bruce perfected his scientific technique at the
			 meteorological observatory on Ben Nevis. Then, over a periond of about 20
			 years, he made repeated visits to the arctic island of Spitsbergen in the
			 Svalbard archipelago, in association with the prince of Monaco. He became the
			 major expert on the area, having carried out meteorological, zoological,
			 geological and geographical surveys of the island. These led to the economic
			 development of the archipelago, mainly for coal mining. Bruce also carried out
			 ornithological work there, discovering new species of arctic bird, and
			 discovering more about known species - he was, for example, the first to find
			 chicks of the sanderling, on Spitsbergen. </p> 
		  <p> The expedition for which he is remembered, however, is the
			 remarkably successful Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of 
			 <date type="inclusive" normal="1902/1904">1902-1904</date>. The
			 observations made by this expedition completely changed the way Antarctica was
			 seen, from a geographical point of view, as well as the way the surrounding
			 islands were seen from a zoological perspective. During this trip, a base was
			 set up on South Georgia, a new area, Coats Land (named in honour of the Coats
			 brothers, who had bankrolled the enterprise) was discovered and 1100 species of
			 animal were catalogued, 212 of them previously unknown to science. The seas
			 around the Antarctic were explored in the yacht 'Scotia'. </p> 
		  <p>Bruce did not, however, always enjoy the good luck that made the
			 Antarctic expedition such a success. In 
			 <date type="single" normal="1907">1907</date>, Bruce founded the
			 Scottish Oceanographical Laboratory, an organisation he had great ambitions
			 for, hoping it would one day challenge Monaco as a centre for oceanographical
			 sciences. However, it was not to be, and it was disbanded in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1920">1920</date>, the year before his
			 death, due to his ill health, and the lack of other people of Bruce's stature
			 to continue the work. In 
			 <date type="inclusive" normal="1910/1911">1910-1911</date>, Bruce
			 tried to raise funds for a second Antarctic expedition, but this enterprise too
			 would end in failure. A whaling business he managed in the Seychelles from 
			 <date type="single" normal="1914">1914</date> failed too, killed off
			 by the outbreak of war. </p> 
		  <p>He was honoured by several learned societies for his work. He did
			 not publish widely nor attempt to publicise his work, and it is perhaps this,
			 along with the lack of spectacular upsets like those that dogged Scott and
			 Shackleton's polar expeditions, that meant Bruce has been largely forgotten by
			 the public.</p>

		  <p>Bruce was influenced by James Cossar Ewart at the University of
			 Edinburgh (<date type="life-span" normal="1851/1933">1851-1933</date>). His
			 Antarctic expedition was funded by the Coats brothers, textile manufacturers
