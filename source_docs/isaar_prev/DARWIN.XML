		  <p>Charles Robert Darwin was born on 
			 <date type="birth" normal="18090209">9 February, 1809</date> in
			 Shrewsbury, Shropshire. He abandoned medical studies in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1827">1827</date> after two years in
			 Edinburgh, but not before friends interested him in geology, in marine
			 wildlife, and in Lamarckian evolutionary zoology. He trained half-heartedly for
			 Anglican ordination in Christ's College, Cambridge, taking a poor degree in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1831">1831</date>, but other friends had
			 by then helped him set his professional sights on geology and natural history,
			 one of them even arranging a volunteer naturalist's berth for him on the
			 Admiralty survey vessel HMS Beagle. Darwin's five years aboard that ship,
			 exploring the Pacific coast of South America, shaped his critical sense that
			 species were a natural record of change, not stasis. He developed the twin
			 notions of geological and biological mutability for which he is famous over the
			 rest of his life. He wrote prolifically from his study in a quiet London
			 suburb, being debarred from a conventional academic life by chronic ill health,
			 possibly due to an infection contracted on his voyage. He died on 
			 <date type="death" normal="18820419">19 April, 1882</date>, and lies
			 buried (by special dispensation from the Church of England) in Westminster
			 Abbey. </p> 
		  <p>Inspired by recent work by Charles Lyell, Darwin laid siege to
			 prevailing opinion that the geology of the earth was the result of successive
			 catastrophes, the latest of which was the flood of Noah. He demonstrated in a
			 trilogy of books on the subject how various natural forces also operated to
			 transform the face of the planet over great amounts of time. Observing also
			 variegation and extinction among species, and impressed by Thomas Robert
			 Malthus' thoughts on the pressure of finite food supply, he suggested a
			 mechanism for how evolutionary principles might work on populations of living
			 things too. The dynamics of adapted variants and ecological niches, he tried to
			 show the new community of paleontologists, could even extend to prehistory.
			 Mature expression of Darwinian evolution in the animal kingdom came in the 
			 <date type="single" normal="1859">1859</date> <bibref><title>On the
			 Origin of Species</title></bibref> and the 
			 <date type="single" normal="1871">1871</date> <bibref><title>The
			 Descent of Man</title></bibref>. Adaptation among plants occupied him late in
			 his career. He produced remarkable studies in the minutiae of things as diverse
			 as phototropism, growth hormones, insect-eating sundews, and the ecological
			 necessity of worms. </p>

		  <p>Darwin was exposed to geology in Edinburgh by Robert Jameson (<date
			 type="life-span" normal="1774/1854">1774-1854</date> ), geologist and professor
			 of natural history, and at Cambridge by Adam Sedgwick (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1854/1913">1854-1913</date>), zoologist. He learned of the early
			 evolutionary teachings of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1744/1829">1744-1829</date>) through his friendship with Robert Edmond
			 Grant (<date type="life-span" normal="1793-1874">1793-1874</date>), Edinburgh
			 zoologist, and grew as a naturalist at Cambridge under the mentorship of
			 botanist and mineralogist John Stevens Henslow (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1796/1861">1796-1861</date>), who subsequently arranged his place on
			 the Beagle. Good friends were Charles Lyell (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1797/1875">1797-1875</date>), geologist, Alfred Russel Wallace (<date
			 type="life-span" normal="1823/1913">1823-1913</date>), naturalist, and Sir
			 Joseph Dalton Hooker (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1817/1911">1817-1911</date>), director of the Royal Gardens, Kew,
			 though not all of them friends of evolution as such, who helped get Darwin's

		  <p>His grandfather was Erasmus Darwin (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1731/1802">1731-1802</date>), a physician, naturalist, poet, and
			 philosopher. His father was Robert Waring Darwin (<date
			 type="life-span" normal="1766/1848">1766-1848</date>), physician. His mother
			 was born Susannah Wedgwood (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1765/1817">1765-1817</date>), daughter of the potter Josiah Wedgwood I
			 (<date type="life-span" normal="1730/1795">1730-1795</date>). His cousin, by
			 second marriage of his Grandfather Erasmus, was Francis Galton (<date
			 type="normal" normal="1822/1911">1822-1911</date>), creator of the science of
			 eugenics. Four of his children were scientists in their own right: Sir George
			 Howard Darwin (<date type="life-span" normal="1845/1912">1845-1912</date>),
			 mathematician and astronomer, Sir Francis Darwin (<date
			 type="life-span" normal="1848/1925">1848-1925</date>), botanist, Leonard Darwin
			 (<date type="life-span" normal="1850/1943">1850-1943</date>), engineer and
			 promoter of eugenics, and Sir Horace Darwin (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1851/1925">1851-1925</date>), scientific engineer and founder of the
			 Cambridge Scientific Instrument Co. His grandson was Charles Galton Darwin
			 (<date type="life-span" normal="1887/1962">1887-1962</date>), mathematician and
			 physicist. </p> 
		  <p>He lived with his wife and children at their home in the village of
