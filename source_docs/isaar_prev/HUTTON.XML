		  <p>James Hutton was most well known for achievements in geology but his
			 interests were not solely confined to this.</p> 
		  <p>His most important contribution to science was his
			 <bibref><title>Theory of the Earth</title>, (<imprint><date type="publication"
			 normal="1785" certainty="certain">1785</date>)</imprint></bibref>. For this
			 theory Hutton has earned the accolade of 'founder of modern geology'. Hutton's
			 theory put forward the idea that fusion of sediments arose by the great heat
			 which he believed to exist beneath the lower regions of the earth's crust.
			 Heat, he claimed, was capable of fusing all the substances found in different
			 types of sediment. He also concluded that the extreme heat that fused the
			 sediments must be capable of producing an "expansive force, sufficient for
			 elevating the land from the bottom of the ocean to the place it now occupies".
			 Hutton then discussed evidence for the action of heat through folds and
			 contortions in rocks and evidence he found in the rocks themselves. He
			 mentioned mineral veins containing matter foreign to the strata they traverse,
			 the widespread occurrence of volcanoes and the occurrence of what he called
			 'subterraneous lavas' (now known to be igneous intrusions).</p> 
		  <p> Finally, Hutton discussed one of the principle objects of his
			 inquiry, the length of time the earth had existed as a habitable world: the
			 question of geological time. Hutton's ideas were based on the length of time it
			 took to wear down the land. This demonstration that the process of
			 sedimentation was cyclical in nature was perhaps the most important advance in
			 geological science embodied in the theory. In his <bibref><title>Theory of the
			 Earth</title>, (<imprint><date type="publication" normal="1785"
			 certainty="certain">1785</date>)</imprint></bibref> he noted: "with respect to
			 Human observation, this world has neither a beginning nor an end" [pp 27-28].
			 This principle is now accepted as axiomatic.</p> 
		  <p>Hutton also made contributions to the study of igneous geology. He
			 established for the first time, the existence of a new class of rocks known as
			 'intrusive igneous'. He concluded that all igneous rocks originated in what he
			 called 'the mineral region', a subcrustal zone of undefined depth in which heat
			 of sufficient intensity to melt rocks prevailed. Apart from geology Hutton had
			 interests in agriculture. For a time, Hutton was himself a farmer, and never
			 lost this passion, for shortly before he died he was engaged in preparing for
			 publication a treatise entitled Principles of Agriculture which still exists in
			 manuscript form.</p> 
		  <p>Hutton also had interests in the physical sciences, in particular,
			 chemistry, physics and meteorology. Toward the end of his life he published a
			 three-part book entitled <bibref><title>Dissertations on Different Subjects in
			 Natural Philosophy</title>, (<imprint><date type="publication" normal="1792"
			 certainty="certain">1792</date>)</imprint></bibref> where he discussed mostly
			 meteorology, phlogiston, and the theory of matter.</p> 
		  <p>Hutton also engaged in more philosophical concerns of the time. He
			 published a three volume treatise on metaphysics and moral philosophy entitled,
			 <bibref><title>An Investigation of the Principles of Knowledge and of the
			 Progress of Reason, From Sense to Science and Philosophy</title>, ( 
			 <imprint><date type="publication" normal="1794"
			 certainty="certain">1794</date>)</imprint></bibref> . In this he outlined a
			 broad deistic line introducing his belief that in nature there is abundant
			 evidence of benevolent wisdom and design.</p>
