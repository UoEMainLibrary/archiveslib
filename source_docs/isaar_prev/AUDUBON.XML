		  <p>John James Audubon (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1785/1851">1785-1851</date>) - real name Jean Jacques
			 Foug&#x00C3;&#x00A8;re Audubon - the French-American artist and ornithologist,
			 was a figure whose life was shrouded in mystery. Born in Haiti, the son of a
			 French father who was having an extra-marital affair with a Creole woman,
			 Audubon was brought up in rural France by his father's wife while his father
			 was a leading revolutionary in Paris. He had a very limited education and no
			 specific artistic or ornithological training. He was sent to the United States
			 when a young man to become a businessman, but he led a bohemian lifestyle,
			 moving from town to town, running unsuccessful businesses and hunting. He spent
			 a period of time in jail for bankruptcy, but was eventually freed with only his
			 gun and the clothes he was standing in.</p> 
		  <p>Over a period of several years, he travelled through the Southern
			 and Mid-Western United States to shoot and paint birds, paying his expenses by
			 painting people's portraits. He was an exceptionally talented artist, and,
			 despite their occasional inaccuracies, his were the best illustrations of
			 American birds to date. Audubon travelled to Britain to find a publisher, and
			 his "<bibref><title>The Birds of America</title>", (<imprint><date
			 type="publication" normal="1827/1838">1827-1838</date></imprint>)</bibref> was
			 published in episodes over a period of 11 years.</p> 
		  <p>Inconsistency was the only continuous factor in his life. When
			 young, Audubon had carried out a number of ingenious experiments on birds, but
			 carelessness and lack of method discredited his results. The notes he took
			 while travelling are disorganised, undetailed and only semi-literate, leaving
			 many of his discoveries to his memory, which cannot have enhanced the accuracy
			 of his books. His recklessness can also be seen in the episode when he gave
			 pictures of imaginary animals to a gullible naturalist as a joke - pictures
			 which went on to be published, causing great confusion. However, he was also
			 the first to attach markers to birds to see if they returned to the same
			 nesting place each year, fifty years before the introduction of bird
			 banding.</p> 
		  <p>Scientifically, his books are of very limited interest - the text
			 merely gives the birds' names along with very general descriptions and a few
			 anecdotes about each. Their true worth is in the illustrations they contain and
			 in the way they popularised ornithology, and made the fauna of the United
			 States known in Europe.</p> 
		  <p>The image of him left behind is romanticised and exaggerated, and
			 bears little resemblance to the man he was.</p>
