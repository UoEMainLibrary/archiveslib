<p>John Boyd Orr, introducer of free school milk and of the aphorism 'freedom 
  from famine', was born in Kilmaurs in Ayrshire in <date normal="1880" type="single">1880</date>. 
  He was educated at the local parish school and at Kilmarnock Academy. At eighteen 
  he left to simultaneously train as a schoolteacher and to study for an MA degree 
  at Glasgow University. At Glasgow he saw the consequences of slum conditions: 
  an experience that made him a passionate humanitarian. This led him to abandon 
  teaching in order to study medicine and biological sciences at Glasgow and, 
  to his final vocation, physiology and nutrition. In <date normal="1914" type="single">1914</date> 
  he went to Aberdeen to establish the Nutrition Institute (Rowett Research Institute 
  from <date normal="1922" type="single">1922</date>). He served in the army and 
  navy in the 1st World War and was decorated twice for bravery. Thereafter, war 
  joined poverty as the potent purpose of his science. During World War 2 he devised 
  a national diet that ensured the UK population was fit to sustain a successful 
  war effort. Boyd Orr believed that greed - for food, land, economic wealth, 
  and the emergent greed for oil - to be the root cause of war. </p> 
		  
<p>In <date normal="1949" type="single">1949</date> he was awarded the Nobel Peace 
  Prize because he had used science as a way of 'making men healthier and happier 
  so as to secure peace' (Nobel Presentation Speech). In his Nobel Acceptance 
  Speech he linked nourishment, economic well-being and the removal of hunger 
  as necessary for world peace. However, Orr saw his life bridging two worlds, 
  and he believed that the destructive force of nuclear war was a new and terrifying 
  possibility. Orr was the first scientist to discover the link between low income 
  and nutritional deprivation and the consequent public outcry in the <date normal="1930/1939" type="inclusive"
			  certainty="uncertain">1930s</date> led to the adoption of his recommendations. 
  These included improvements in agricultural output and increased consumption 
  as consequent on the lowering of food prices. His work on the National Council 
  for the Development of Scotland was later adopted as UK national policy and 
  was amongst the most successful of the Welfare State reforms of the Modernist 
  era. </p> 
		  
<p>The introduction of free school milk - a simple and practical measure - contributed 
  to the disappearance of rickets from Britain's poor children. This alone demonstrates 
  his ability as a scientist to see the general arising from the particular, and 
  as a humanitarian his determination that knowledge should benefit ordinary people. 
  Orr saw nutrition, productivity, national regeneration, freedom from class and 
  national conflicts as interdependent and interrelated. After <date normal="1945" type="single">1945</date> 
  his ideas on international food rationing influenced policy in the USA, and 
  crucially prevented famine in Europe. As director-general of the United Nations 
  Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) he ensured the <date normal="1939/1970" certainty="uncertain" type="inclusive">mid 
  20th century</date> and <date normal="1960/1999" type="inclusive" certainty="uncertain">late 
  20th century</date> acceptance of famine as an international responsibility. 
  However, he felt bureaucracy and politics inhibited his work at the FAO and 
  he resigned to promote the cause of world government that, he believed, could 
  mount a two-pronged attack on famine. Firstly, by third world agricultural development, 
  and secondly through the World Bank as controller of food prices on the world 
  markets, and by the sale of food surpluses and the accumulation of food reserves. 
  Linked to this was the aim of world peace that he actively pursued through a 
  number of international peace organisations. The Nobel Peace Prize and a building 
  at Glasgow University, named in his honour, are his monuments.</p>
