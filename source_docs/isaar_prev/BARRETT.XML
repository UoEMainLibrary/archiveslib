		  <p>Lucas Barrett (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1837/1862">1837-1862</date>), a geologist, was the son of an
			 ironfounder, and was educated at Ashton's School, Royston, Cambridgeshire, then
			 at University College School. He did not go to university. From an early age,
			 Barrett showed an interest in geology, spending time in local chalk quarries as
			 a child, looking for fossils. He was also a frequent visitor to the British
			 Museum's natural history galleries during his schooldays. In 
			 <date type="single" normal="1853">1853</date>, after completing
			 school, he spent a short period of time in Ebersdorf (Germany) to study
			 chemistry and German. He made a geological trip to Bavaria in this time. </p> 
		  <p>Aged just 18, Barrett was appointed as curator of the Woodwardian
			 Museum in Cambridge, and was elected a Fellow of the Geological Society of
			 London, the youngest person ever to be elected to this body. He also worked for
			 Professor Adam Sedgwick (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1785/1873">1785-1873</date>) at this time, by delivering lectures on
			 his behalf. From 
			 <date type="inclusive" normal="1855/1857">1855-1857</date>, he spent
			 the summer months carrying out surveys of the waters between Shetland and
			 Norway (in association with R McAndrew, in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1855">1855</date>), and the coastal
			 waters of Greenland (<date type="single" normal="1856">1856</date>) and Spain
			 (<date type="single" normal="1857">1857</date>). These expeditions gave him
			 extensive knowledge of marine science. During his period in Cambridge, he
			 prepared a detailed geological map of Cambridgeshire, which was reprinted
			 several times.</p> 
		  <p>In 
			 <date type="appointmentdate" normal="1859">1859</date>, he was
			 appointed to the post of Director of the Geological Survey of Jamaica. While in
			 Jamaica, he determined the cretaceous age of the limestone that forms part of
			 the Blue Mountains - this he did by examining the fossilised shells encased in
			 the rock. One of these shells was of a previously undiscovered type, and was
			 named "Barrettia" in his honour. He also showed that the orbitoidal limestone
			 of Jamaica, previously thought to be of the carboniferous age, was, in fact,
			 Miocene. He also conducted experiments at sea off Jamaica, repeating the tests
			 he had carried out in European waters several years earlier. He found the two
			 areas to have very similar fauna, making him conclude that 90% of the globe's
			 ocean beds form a "nearly uniform province all over the world".</p> 
		  <p>In 
			 <date type="single" normal="1862">1862</date>, he returned briefly to
			 Britain, in order to act as commissioner for Jamaica at the International
			 Exhibition. He acquired a diving suit before returning to Jamaica, where he
			 used it to examine coral reefs. After several successful descents in shallow
			 waters, he was drowned during a dive in deeper waters off Kingston, aged only
			 25.</p>
