		  <p>Fraser Roberts studied the science of genetics in its application to
			 inheritance in humans. His interest focused on the application of laboratory
			 and statistical knowledge in the field, and ultimately he became a pioneer of
			 genetic counselling. He was the eldest child of a Welsh farmer and a Scots
			 mother. Early in life he showed an interest in the attempts of local farmers to
			 improve their sheep flocks by selective breeding - even then, as later in life,
			 he loved collecting data, plotting it onto graphs and in statistics.</p>
		  <p> He had achieved university entrance qualification by the age of 15,
			 and in 
			 <date normal="1916" type="single">1916</date> he went to University
			 College, South Wales to study agriculture. In 
			 <date normal="1920" type="single">1920</date> he moved to Cambridge
			 where he first undertook research into sheep. This brought him into contact
			 with Professor F.A.E. Crew (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1886/1973">1886-1973</date>) at the Institute of Animal Breeding at the
			 University of Edinburgh, and he went to Edinburgh in 
			 <date normal="1923" type="single">1923</date>. Whilst there his
			 genetical research was leading him more towards human work, and Crew suggested
			 that he study medicine. Thus he became a medical graduate of the University of
			 Edinburgh in 
			 <date normal="1936" type="single">1936</date>. </p>
		  <p>During World War II he served as a surgeon-commander in the RNVR and
			 assisted the Admiralty with the collation of statistical material. After the
			 war he returned to Edinburgh and qualified M.D. in 
			 <date normal="1943" type="single">1943</date> for his thesis on the
			 distribution of blood groups between the people of North Wales and southern
			 England. Since 
			 <date normal="1933" type="single">1933</date> he had been involved in
			 the Burden Mental Health Research Department at the Stoke Park Colony, Bristol.
			 His early work there involved the assessment of intelligence and by 
			 <date normal="1946" type="single">1946</date> this interest had
			 developed into pioneering work in genetic counselling. He founded the first
			 genetic counselling clinic in Europe at the Hospital for Sick Children, Great
			 Ormand Street in 
			 <date normal="1946" type="single">1946</date>, and was the first
			 Director of the Clinical Genetics Research Unit there from 
			 <date normal="1957" type="single">1957</date> until he retired in 
			 <date normal="1964" type="single">1964</date>. </p>
		  <p>The research he carried out at that time provided much-needed data
			 derived from systematic laboratory and family studies on the incidence and
			 frequency of inherited disease. This information enabled counsellors to provide
			 a coherent picture to their clients of the risks of inherited disease in their
			 families. In addition to his work on intelligence he also examined the
			 relationship between blood group and inherited disease, and the genetical
			 causes of high blood pressure and diseases of the nervous system. The precision
			 and clarity that he brought to his research is evident in his book, An
			 Introduction to Medical Genetics, the first student text on genetics. It is
			 still highly regarded and went into eight editions from 
			 <date normal="1940/1985" type="publication">1940-1985</date>.</p>
