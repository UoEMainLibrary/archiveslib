<p>Charlotte Auerbach was born into a learned artistic and scientific Jewish family. 
  She went to school in Berlin and in <date normal="1919" type="single">1919</date> 
  she began her studies in biology, chemistry, physics and the philosophy of David 
  Hume (<date
			 normal="1711/1776" type="life-span">1711-1776)</date> at Berlin, 
  Wurtzburg and Freiburg. Because of antisemitism the period between <date normal="1924/1933" type="inclusive">1924-1933</date> 
  was one of erratic employment as either a schoolteacher or researcher: she was 
  dismissed or forced to leave many jobs. She fled Nazi Germany on the advice 
  of her mother and arrived in England where a family friend introduced her to 
  Professor Barger at Edinburgh University. Through Barger she met Professor Crew 
  and, along with a number of other refugees of totalitarianism, she joined the 
  Institute of Animal Genetics at Edinburgh as a Ph.D student. According to Auerbach 
  Crew ran the department as his private club with social gatherings in the evenings 
  and at weekends. From <date normal="1938" type="single">1938</date>, the reknowned 
  Russian geneticist Hermann Joseph Muller (<date normal="1890/1967"
			 type="life-span">1890-1967</date>) joined the Institute - this according 
  to Lotte changed her whole life as he introduced her to mutagenics. She first 
  came to notice as a scientist in <date normal="1941/1942" type="inclusive">1941-1942</date> 
  when with AJ Clark and JM Robson she discovered that mustard gas, a highly toxic 
  substance that had been used in trench warfare, caused genetic mutation in fruit 
  flies (Drosophila). In so doing she founded the study of gene mutation by chemicals 
  - mutagenisis was her personal contribution to science. Her approach was biological 
  rather than chemical in that, while she acknowledged that mutation took place 
  in the chemistry of the gene, she adhered to the idea that it was the biological 
  interaction that gave the process its complexity. She used Drosophila, and later, 
  microorganisms such as Neurospora and yeasts to test the mutagenic properties 
  of other agents (mustard gas had proved too dangerous). From this she pursued 
  four lines of enquiry: the patterns of combinations called mosaics (mutant and 
  non-mutant cells), that increased mutation occurred in delayed or stored genes 
  affected by a mutagen, 'replicating instabilities', i.e., that mosaics produced 
  more mosaics in later generations, and that in 'specifity'- parts of the gene 
  were affected differently by mutagenisis. Lotte was profoundly independent and 
  as a scientist, and compassionate as a person: she supported CND, loathed racism, 
  and adored children. In <date normal="1947" type="single">1947</date> she published 
  under the pseudonym, Charlotte Austen (a favourite author in her childhood) 
  a popular book of fairy stories called Adventures with Rosalind.</p>

		  <p>Charlotte Auerbach was the grandchild of Leopold Auerbach
			 (1828-1897), the neuro-anatomist and discoverer of Auerbach's plexus, and the
			 daughter of the chemist, Friedrich Auerbach (1870-1925). Lotte's principal
			 collaborators in research and publication were H Moser, AJ Clark, PT Shukla and
			 JM Robson on mustard gas and other chemical mutagenic agents of Drosophila, FAE
			 Crew on the mutagenesis of the mouse, and D Ramsay on Neurospora.</p>
