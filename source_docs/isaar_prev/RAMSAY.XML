		  <p>Sir Andrew Crombie Ramsay, who was the son of a Glasgow dye
			 manufacturer, became involved with the study of geology comparatively late in
			 life. His first major geological work came in Autumn 
			 <date type="single" normal="1840">1840</date> when he was
			 instrumental in the preparation of a geological model of the island of Arran,
			 for the British Association for the Advancement of Science. The competence he
			 showed in this endeavour, and his subsequent preparation of a guided visit to
			 the island for members of the association (which never took place), convinced
			 Roderick Impey Murchison of his worth, and Murchison obtained a post at the
			 Geological Survey of Great Britain for him. He subsequently occupied a number
			 of positions in University College London, the Government School of Mines and
			 the Geological Survey, which culminated in him being appointed Director-General
			 of the latter in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1871">1871</date>.</p> 
		  <p>Over his career, Ramsay produced between forty and fifty scientific
			 papers. His most important work was on glaciation, denudation and fluvial
			 systems. He controversially - though largely correctly - explained how certain
			 mountain valleys and lakes were formed by the glaciers that once flowed through
			 them. His work on denudation was based on his study of South Wales, in which he
			 proved, from study of strata, that the area had experienced substantial
			 denudation in the distant past. His work on rivers, in particular the Rhine, is
			 considered less interesting and remains controversial.</p> 
		  <p>Ramsay's main interests surrounded geomorphology, stratigraphy and
			 the origin of geographical features. He had little time for palaeontology and
			 petrology, and it is said that this refusal to look at theories that did not
			 interest him was the cause of many of his mistakes.</p>
