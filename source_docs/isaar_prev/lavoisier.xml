		  <p>Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier was born in 1743. He studied mathematics
			 and astronomy with Nicolas de Lacaille (<date normal="1713/1762"
			 type="life-span">1713-1762</date>), chemistry with Guillaume-Fran&#x00E7;ois
			 Rouelle (<date normal="1703/1770" type="life-span">1703-1770</date>) and botany
			 with Bernard de Jussieu (<date normal="1699/1777"
			 type="life-span">1699-1777</date>) at the Coll&#x00E8;ge Mazarin. From 
			 <date normal="1763/1767" type="inclusive">1763-1767</date> he studied
			 geology under Jean Etienne Guettard (<date normal="1715/1786"
			 type="life-span">1715-1786</date>). He was one of the best known French
			 scientists and an important government official. His theories of combustion,
			 and his development of a new system of chemical nomenclature and the first
			 modern textbook of chemistry led to his being known as the father of modern
			 chemistry. As a scientist, Lavoisier demonstrated the nature of combustion,
			 disproving the phlogiston theory. He also proposed the name "oxygen" for the
			 substance previously known as "dephilogisticated air," and laid the framework
			 for understanding chemical reactions as combinations of elements to form new
			 materials.</p> 
		  <p>As a government official, Lavoisier was successful in creating
			 agricultural reform, serving as a tax collection official, and overseeing the
			 government's manufacture of gunpowder. In 
			 <date normal="1787" type="single">1787</date> Irenee du Pont was
			 apprenticed as a bookkeeper to Lavoisier, then Commissioner of Powders. Over
			 the three years he was with Lavoisier at the Royal Arsenal, Irenee was exposed
			 to the art of gunpowder making. Lavoisier, who was responsible for changing
			 French gunpowder from the very worst to the very best in the world, then
			 offered the young Irenee a job at the powder factory outside of Paris. In 1765
			 he wrote and published a paper on how to improve the street lighting in Paris.
			 For this and some works on agriculture, he was elected into the Royal Academy
			 of Science in 1768. Also in this year, he joined the Farmer's General, a
			 private company that collected taxes and tariffs for the government. In 1775,
			 Lavoisier was appointed to the National Gunpowder Commission. He then moved to
			 the Arsenal of Paris where he created a superb laboratory for his growing
			 experimentation. In large part, he was able to afford his experiments and such
			 a laboratory because of his inherited wealth. His new home quickly became a
			 gathering place for scientists and freethinkers. Lavoisier was politically
			 liberal and shared many of the ideas of the philosophers. He was deeply
			 persuaded of the need for social reform in France. Because of this, he played
			 an active part in the events preceeding the French Revolution. He served on a
			 committee concerned with the social conditions of France and proposed tax
			 reforms and new economic strategies. He also served on a committee that
			 explored hospitals and prisons of Paris and then recommended remedies for their
			 horrible state. During the revolution, he published a report on the state of
			 France's finances. When the Estate's General reconvened in 1789, he became an
			 alternate deputy and drew up a code of instructions for the other deputies to
			 follow. Soon after the revolution began, Jean-Paul Marat and other radical
			 journalists began to slander Lavoisier for being a member of the Farmer's
			 General. On May 8th, 1794, all of the Farmer's General were arrested and thrown
			 in prison. In a trial that lasted less than a day, they were all convicted and
			 sentenced to execution.</p>
