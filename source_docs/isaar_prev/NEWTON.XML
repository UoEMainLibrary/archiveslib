		  <p>Sir Isaac Newton was born on 
			 <date type="single" normal="16421225">25 December 1642</date> in
			 Woolsthorpe, near Grantham in Lincolnshire. He was educated at Trinity College,
			 Cambridge, where he lived from 
			 <date type="single" normal="1661">1661</date> to 
			 <date type="single" normal="1696">1696</date>. In 
			 <date type="single" normal="1696">1696</date> he was appointed Master
			 of the Royal Mint, and moved to London, where he resided until his death.
			 Beginning in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1714">1714</date> he served on the
			 government's Board of Longitude. Newton died in London on 
			 <date type="single" normal="17270320">20 March 1727</date> and was
			 buried in Westminster Abbey, the first scientist to be accorded this honor.
			 </p> 
		  <p>Mathematics: Newton invented integral calculus, and simultaneously
			 with Leibniz, differential calculus. Physics: He defined universal laws of
			 motion and gravitation, and made numerous advances in the principals of
			 reflection and refraction. Astronomy: combining his work in mathematics,
			 statics, and optics, he was able to predict the motions of bodies in the
			 heavens, and build a practical reflecting telescope to see them. His
			 improvements to instrumentation also extended to a better sextant, and an
			 enormous composite burning glass. Chemistry: He derived a precursor to the
			 famous Laplacian formula for finding the velocity of sound in a gas, and he
			 experimented with metal alloys for better telescope reflectors. His
			 metallurgical efforts may have elided with a private interest in alchemy.
			 Newton's most influential works were the
			 <bibref><title>Principia</title></bibref> (<date normal="1687"
			 type="publication">1687</date>) and <bibref><title>Opticks</title></bibref>
			 (<date normal="1704" type="single">1704</date>). </p>

		<relships encodinganalog="isaar228"> 
		  <head>Relationships</head> 
		  <p>Newton's preoccupation was his dispute with Gottfried Willhelm
			 Leibniz (<date type="lifespan" normal="1646/1716">1646-1716</date>) over which
			 of them invented the calculus first. Less famously he quarreled over other
			 things with Robert Hooke (<date type="lifespan"
			 normal="1635/1703">1635-1703</date>) and John Flamsteed (<date type="lifespan"
			 normal="1646/1719">1646-1719</date>). He carried on routine professional
			 correspondence with Robert Boyle (<date type="lifespan"
			 normal="1627/1691">1627-1691</date>), Fatio De Duillier (<date type="lifespan"
			 normal="1664/1753">1664-1753</date>), Edmund Halley (<date type="lifespan"
			 normal="1656/1742">1656-1742</date>), David Gregory (<date type="lifespan"
			 normal="1659/1710">1659-1710</date>), and others. He may also have corresponded
			 with clandestine circles of alchemists. </p> 
		  <p>Humphrey Babington, a Senior Fellow in Trinity, and brother of
			 Newton's grammar-school landlady, may have stood behind his appointments in
			 Trinity. Isaac Barrow probably arranged for Newton to succeed him as Lucasian
			 Professor, and may have arranged for the royal dispensation that freed him from
			 the chair's stipulation for ordination in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1675">1675</date>. Charles Montague, a
			 prominent Whig, helped bring about Newton's appointment to the Mint and later
			 his knighthood. Two other influential friends were Princess Caroline and her
			 husband, eventually George II. </p> 
		  <p>Isaac Newton, his father, an illiterate but prosperous yeoman
			 farmer, died before his only son was born. Young Isaac's stepfather, with whom
			 he never lived, was the Rev Barnabas Smith. </p>
