		  <p>James Cameron Smail (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1880/1970">1880-1970</date>) was principal of Heriot-Watt College and
			 the architect of a period of considerable expansion in the college. </p> 
		  <p>Smail was educated at Daniel Stewart's College in Edinburgh, before
			 entering higher education at Heriot-Watt College, where he studied engineering.
			 He also spent time at the Royal College of Science and the London School of
			 Economics. In 
			 <date type="appointmentdate" normal="1911">1911</date>, after several
			 years in the government of Ireland, working for the Department of Agriculture
			 and Technical Instruction, he entered into employment with the London County
			 Council. He held a number of positions over the years, including Head of the
			 Trade Schools, Head of the Technology Branch and others, but his most famous
			 contribution was as District Manager of the Metropolitan Munitions Committee.
			 In this wartime post, he directed the manufacture of munitions in the
			 department's workshops. For this, he was awarded his MBE.</p> 
		  <p>On leaving the London County Council in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1928">1928</date>, he was appointed
			 principal of his alma mater, Heriot-Watt. During his tenure, the college
			 underwent a series of changes, but Smail's modernisation of the organisation
			 was cut short by the Second World War, and was only completed by his successor,
			 Hugh Bryan Nisbet (<date type="life-span" normal="1902/1969">1902-1969</date>).
			 Nonetheless, Smail was able to expand the college's real estate from the
			 cramped accommodation that it had, until then, occupied, re-established the
			 chair of physics and the department of pharmacy. He also established the first
			 proper library the college ever had. This library is now called the Cameron
			 Smail library, in his honour. He also fostered links with other technical
			 institutions, through the Association of Technical Institutions and the
			 Association of Principals of Technical Institutions.</p> 
		  <p>Smail chose to support many educational and cultural organisations.
			 He sat on the boards of several learned societies, was a member of the Advisory
			 Council of the Scottish Education Department, served as vice-president of the
			 Royal Society of Edinburgh, was president of the Royal Scottish Society of Arts
			 and chairman of the council of the Royal Scottish Geological Society, to name
			 but a few of the positions he held.</p>
