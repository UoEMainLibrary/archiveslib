		  <p>George Bennie was born in 
			 <date type="birth" normal="1892">1892</date> at Auldhouse, Glasgow,
			 the son of an engineer, but spent much of his younger life at Rothesay. Though
			 he had a Glasgow address in the 
			 <date type="inclusive" normal="1925/1935"
			  certainty="uncertain">1930s</date>, he maintained his home at Normanhurst,
			 Bute.</p> 
		  <p>He patented a number of inventions, one of the first being a stable
			 ashtray which could be used at sea. Soon he turned his inventive talents
			 towards the sphere of public transportation and developed an idea for a
			 monorail type system - the 'Railplane'. This was designed to achieve far
			 greater speeds than existing railway stock, without the inherent risks which
			 ocurred when using the existing type of track and locomotive.</p> 
		  <p>The design for the Railplane vehicle and carriages drew heavily on
			 the design technology of the aircraft industry and they were built by Beardmore
			 Engineering Co., Inchinnan, who had been involved in building airships, amongst
			 many other products. The track was supported by a structure of girders which
			 could straddle an existing railway track, allowing goods trains to pass below.
			 In an LNER siding at Burnbrae, near Milngavie on the periphery of Glasgow a
			 test line was constructed.</p> 
		  <p>The official launch of Railplane in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1930">1930</date> was greeted with much
			 enthusiasm and acclaim, despite the length of the track being insufficient for
			 the vehicle to reach the optimum 150 miles per hour (only 50 miles per hour was
			 achieved). Unfortunately this was not translated into the necessary financial
			 backing that Bennie needed to further the project. The proposed line from
			 Edinburgh to Glasgow was not built, nor was the one between Southport and
			 Blackpool. By 
			 <date type="single" normal="1937">1937</date>, Bennie was bankrupt.
			 He had financed most of the work himself. The test line remained a feature on
			 the Glasgow landscape until a year before Bennie's death, when it was
			 demolished for scrap.</p>
