		  <p>John Arbuthnot (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1667/1735">1667-1735</date>), physician to Queen Anne (<date
			 type="life-span" normal="1665/1714">1665-1714</date>), was educated at
			 Marischal College, Aberdeen and took his degree in Medicine at the University
			 of St Andrews. Better known for his political satire and statistical analysis,
			 he taught mathematics in London for a while, until he had the good fortune to
			 be present when Prince George of Denmark (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1653/1708">1653-1708</date>) fell ill. Arbuthnot's treatment cured the
			 prince, and he was taken on in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1705">1705</date> as physician
			 extraordinary to Queen Anne. In 
			 <date type="single" normal="1709">1709</date>, he became physician in
			 ordinary to the monarch. Arbuthnot's first paper to the Royal Society was a
			 statistical study of demographics. He also translated a work by Huygens (<date
			 type="life-span" normal="1629/1695">1629-1695</date>) about probability.</p> 
		  <p>Arbuthnot was at Queen Anne's bedside when she died, and under the
			 new regime, Arbuthnot fell out of favour and ceased to be a courtier.</p> 
		  <p>Arbuthnot's paper, presented at the Royal Society in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1710">1710</date>, is worth a closer
			 look, for though it is crude, and far from conclusive; it is the first known
			 example of statistical inference. In this paper, <bibref><title>An Argument for
			 Divine Providence, Taken From the Constant Regularity Observ'd in the Births of
			 Both Sexes</title></bibref>, he looks at births in London in the years 
			 <date type="inclusive" normal="1629/1710">1629-1710</date> inclusive,
			 a total of 82 years. What Arbuthnot noticed, is that in every single one of
			 these years, male births outstripped female births. He argued that if sex was
			 determined by chance - he used the image of a "two-sided die" being thrown -
			 then only in about half of these years would male births have outstripped
			 female births. The probability of all these years giving a male surplus, he
			 said, was 1/(2^82) - astronomical odds against. He suggested that this was the
			 effect of divine intervention, to make up for the increased risks of premature
			 death men experienced at the time.</p> 
		  <p>Whatever the merits of the paper and its dogmatic assumptions, it
			 was the first of many statistical analyses of science, and laid the foundations
			 for the modern science of statistics.</p>

		  <p>Interests and activities:</p> 
		  <p>Arbuthnot was primarily a satirist, being a prominent member of the
			 Scriblerus Club. The Scriblerus Club existed in order to " ridicule false
			 tastes in learning" and bad literature. They wrote the <bibref><title>Memoirs
			 of Martinus Scriblerus</title></bibref> as a group effort, though the vast
			 majority of the work was Arbuthnot's. He also created the patriotic character
			 John Bull in his series <bibref><title>The History of John
			 Bull</title></bibref>, a satire on the intrigue in European diplomacy disguised
			 as a courtroom drama. </p>
