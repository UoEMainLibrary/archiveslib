		  <p>Geoffrey Ingram Taylor has been described as 'one of the great
			 physical scientists of this century'. He was an intuitive, independent and
			 original thinker with an 'adventurous curiosity' (Batchelor, 1996) in the
			 tradition of Clerk Maxwell, Kelvin and Rayleigh. He was born and educated in
			 London where his father was an artist. He decided to become a scientist at the
			 age of eleven after attending lectures on telegraphy at the Royal Institution.
			 He became an enthusiastic amateur, and with the assistance of his friends and
			 his mother (a daughter of the scientist George Boole) he conducted experiments
			 at home. Whilst still at school he constructed a sea-worthy sailing dingy in
			 his bedroom. Some of his experimental methods were deceptively simple and used
			 everyday objects such as adhesive tape, paint rollers and water-bells.
			 Similarly, in later years he often illustrated his ideas with ingenious models.
			 In his final year at the University College School he obtained a scholarship to
			 Trinity College, Cambridge where he studied mathematics and natural science. He
			 graduated in 
			 <date normal="1908" type="single">1908</date> and was awarded a major
			 scholarship. His first research paper in 
			 <date normal="1909" type="single">1909</date> was on quanta. His
			 later studies on continuum mechanics, meteorology and dislocation theory took
			 place entirely at Trinity and the Cavendish Laboratories. During World War I he
			 was employed by the Royal Flying Corps and trained as a pilot in order to
			 better design aircraft propellors. From his knowledge of meteorology and
			 working with wind tunnels in the laboratory he improved the design of aircraft
			 wings. However, his greatest contribution to science was in fluid mechanics and
			 the statistical theory of turbulence in which he was able to exercise his
			 considerable gift in mathematics. His studies of velocity fluctuations and
			 distribution arrived at a description of turbulence based on a statistical
			 method that is still taught today. His investigation of the stability of steady
			 flow between concentric circular cylinders in relative rotation was a classic
			 investigation that established hydrodynamic stability studies as a branch of
			 the science of fluid mechanics. During World War II he carried out experiments
			 on the detonation and impact of high explosives, and later in the war this
			 included nuclear work at Los Alamos. After the war his work in this and on the
			 development of supersonic aircraft was of considerable importance to the
			 government and he was a member of the Aeronautical Research Committee. He
			 retired in 
			 <date normal="1952" type="single">1952</date>, but continued to work
			 as before. He now concentrated on problems that he could work on in a simple
			 laboratory - this suited his tendency to solve problems by reference to
			 concrete images. For instance, it was not known in 
			 <date normal="1954" type="single">1954</date> how to measure the
			 second ceofficient of viscocity. Taylor devised a incompressible liquid with
			 separated gas bubbles suspended in it. The dissipation of the gas in the liquid
			 during expansion was a consequence of the shear viscosity of the liquid. Thus
			 the bulk viscocity could be easily calculated. Other late work included the
			 longitudinal dispersion in flow in tubes, movement through porous surfaces and
			 the dynamics of sheets of liquids. His final research paper was published when
			 he was 83, six years before he died. In this he resumed his interest in
			 electrical activity in thunderstorms (jets of conducting liquid motivated by
			 electrical fields). G.I. Taylor was essentially an applied scientist, for
			 instance, in the 
			 <date normal="1930/1939" type="inclusive"
			  certainty="uncertain">1930s</date> he invented the 'CQR' anchor which was far
			 stronger and more manageable and that any used hitherto - it was used for all
			 sorts of smaller craft including seaplanes. Aspects of his life were subsumed
			 into his work. His recurrent interest in the movement of air and water, and by
			 extension his studies of the movement of unicellular marine creatures and the
			 weather, were related to his life-long love of sailing.</p> 
		  <p>At the outbreak of World war I, Taylor was employed in the design
			 and operation of aeroplanes. This work led him to think about the limiting
			 strengths of materials and greatly impacted on his future projects in later
			 life. Upon his return from the War, Taylor became in 
			 <date normal="1923" type="appointmentdate">1923</date>, the Royal
			 Society Yarrow research professor, enabling him to cease teaching activities,
			 which he had never truly enjoyed. During World War II he was a consultant and
			 adviser to civil and military authorities on high explosives, researching the
			 effects of blast-waves, and when the war was over he took up his research once
			 again until he retired in 
			 <date normal="1952" type="single">1952</date>. Despite this he
			 continued his research at Cambridge until 
			 <date normal="1972" type="single">1972</date>. Geoffrey Ingram Taylor
			 was elected to membership of academic societies in many countries including the
			 United States, France, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands, India, Poland and USSR.
			 He received honorary degrees from more than a dozen universities around the
			 world and over twenty medals for his contributions to applied mathematics.</p>

		  <p>During World War I he worked with A.A. Griffiths on fluid mechanics.
			 Between the wars he collaborated with C.F. Elam and W.S. Farren on crystals. In
			 the 
			 <date normal="1930/1939" type="inclusive"
			  certainty="uncertain">1930s</date> he worked with J.W. MacColl on the
			 aerodynamics at supersonic speeds, and with H. Quinney on metallurgy. During
