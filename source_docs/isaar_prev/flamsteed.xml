		  <p>John Flamsteed (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1646/1719">1646-1719</date>) was the first astronomer royal of England.
			 His legacy to the science of astronomy was mostly in more accurate mapping of
			 the skies, rather than radical new theories. He had limited formal education,
			 having left Derby Free School due to ill health, but he did benefit from
			 tutoring, and his illness led to his first experience of astronomy: unable to
			 attend school, he observed the partial solar eclipse of 
			 <date type="single" normal="16620912">12 September 1662</date>.</p> 
		  <p>Flamsteed's favour with the King improved dramatically in the winter
			 of 
			 <date type="inclusive" normal="1674/1675"
			 certainty="uncertain">1674-1675</date>, when a French courtier of Charles II
			 suggested a method of calculating longitude, accurate knowledge of which is
			 crucial for safe navigation. Flamsteed demonstrated that the theory was
			 impractical due to the inexactitude of existing stellar measurements, which had
			 not been refined since the time of Tycho de Brahe (<date normal="1546/1601"
			 type="life-span">1546-1601</date>), before the time of telescope when
			 telescopes were not used. For a seafaring nation like England, safe navigation
			 was crucial, and Flamsteed's proof of the stellar tables' inaccuracy was noted.
			 Plans to establish a royal observatory, which had been semi-dormant for some
			 time, were rapidly revived, and Flamsteed was appointed as the first astronomer
			 royal (specifically ordered to make observations relevant to navigation), and
			 the Greenwich Observatory was constructed. </p> 
		  <p>Though he was underpaid, his observatory underfunded, and the
			 initial government enthusiasm for astronomical matters was short-lived,
			 Flamsteed set to work making his observations. He used a new method of defining
			 stars' positions, which radically improved accuracy. The uncertainties and
			 errors in these measurements were smaller than those in Tycho de Brahe's
			 (admirable) results by a factor of fifteen. His discoveries elicited the
			 curiosity of fellow astronomer Edmund Halley (<date normal="1656/1742"
			 type="life-span">1656-1742</date>) and physicist Isaac Newton (<date
			 normal="1643/1727" type="life-span">1643-1727</date>).</p> 
		  <p>Flamsteed always had a deep dislike for Halley - probably because of
			 their conflicting personalities more than simple professional rivalry - but
			 initially had friendly relations with Newton. However, as Newton insinuated
			 himself more and more into Flamsteed's work (he needed Flamsteed's observations
			 of the Moon to establish his theories), their relations deteriorated.
			 Eventually, Halley and Newton conspired to publish Flamsteed's work (as the
			 <bibref><title>Historia Coelestis</title></bibref>), against his expressed
			 wishes (the data was incomplete and not yet up to his high standards of
			 accuracy). Flamsteed and Newton's feuding - particularly Newton's arrogance and
			 Flamsteed's obstruction of Newton's quest for information - had a negative
			 impact on the progress of science, Newton having abandoned some of his studies
			 of the Moon because of Flamsteed's refusal to provide data on its orbit.</p> 
		  <p>Flamsteed's least celebrated 'achievement' was to 'prove' stellar
			 parallax, a problem which had obsessed astronomy since Copernicus had suggested
			 the heliocentric system. His 'discovery', however, was worthless; the altered
			 positions of the fixed stars were due to aberrations in the light of the stars
			 that he observed. His error was so precisely noted, however, that the precise
			 nature of the aberrations can now be precisely computed.</p> 
		  <p>The complete, authorised version of Flamsteed's observations was
			 only published posthumously (completed by his assistants) as the
			 <bibref><title>Historia Coelestis Britannica</title></bibref>, including data
			 on the positions of nearly 3000 stars - including a number of sightings of
			 Uranus, which he believed to be a fixed star.</p>
