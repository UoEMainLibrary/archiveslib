		  <p>David Gregory, nephew of the famous St Andrews mathematician James
			 Gregorie (<date type="life-span" normal="1638/1675">1638-1675</date>), was born
			 in Upper Kirkgate, Aberdeen, on 
			 <date type="birth" normal="16590603">03 June, 1659</date>. He was
			 educated for a while at nearby Marischal College, was endowed financially by
			 the murder of his older brother, and was set loose to pursue his private
			 interests in maths, physics, and astronomy. Without graduating from Marischal,
			 he unhorsed the mathematics chairman at Edinburgh University in a broadsheet
			 debate in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1683">1683</date> and took his job. He
			 was given a hasty MA from Edinburgh for decorum's sake, and he taught
			 mathematics for seven years, and also optics, mechanics, hydrostatics, and even
			 anatomy. Town-gown quarrels arose in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1689">1689</date>, turned gradually
			 libellous, and eventually attracted the Hanoverian committee of visitation then
			 scouring Scottish universities for Cartesians and other treasoners. Not holding
			 any truly radical views on anything, Gregory nevertheless saw fit by 
			 <date type="single" normal="1691">1691</date> to take a fresh
			 appointment comfortably far away, in Oxford. This was the Savilian chair of
			 astronomy, in which he spent the rest of his professional life. With his new
			 post he was given another MA and a desultory MD, along with a non-fellow 'MA
			 commoner' appointment in Balliol College and membership in the Royal Society.
			 He took a quick trip to Flanders in 1693, then settled into productive teaching
			 and publishing until<date type="single" normal="1707">1707</date>, the year in
			 which the Act of Union between Scotland and England drew him to work on
			 government fiscal matters instead of science. He was chiefly responsible for
			 rationalizing the Scottish Mint, even as his mentor Sir Isaac Newton was doing
			 for the London Mint. His health failed him during his official travelling, and
			 he died in a Maidenhead inn on 
			 <date type="death" normal="17081010">10 October, 1708</date>. </p> 
		  <p>In his lectures and his principal textbook, Professor Gregory was
			 the first to cast astronomy completely in the alloy of Newtonian gravitational
			 principles. He also gave undergraduates an enduringly useful guide to optics,
			 whose special contribution was to propose an achromatic telescope. More
			 generally he extended his uncle's work on quadrature by infinite series, and
			 shed light on vexing issues in mathematics and theoretical astronomy, including
			 the catenary curve, eclipses, the 'parallax problem', and the Cassinian orbital
			 model for comets. </p>

			 and John Flamsteed (<date type="life-span"
			 normal="1646/1719">1646-1719</date>). On the continent, Gregory maintained
			 close correspondence with Jan Hudde (<date type="life-span"
