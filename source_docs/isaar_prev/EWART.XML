		  <p>James Cossar Ewart dedicated more than half a century of his life to
			 the field of zoology. He was also a pioneer in the study of hybridization and
			 other issues surrounding animal breeding. </p> 
		  <p>Cossar Ewart entered the University of Edinburgh as a medical
			 student in 1871. After graduating three years later he acted as a demonstrator
			 of anatomy under William Turner and was then appointed Curator of the
			 Zoological Museum at University College, London. His main contribution to the
			 department, which was run at the time by professor Ray Lankester, was to help
			 organise the first course of practical zoology in the College. Between 
			 <date normal="1874/1878" type="publication">1874-1878</date> he
			 published several papers on subjects ranging from the structure of the lens and
			 retina and the life history of lower organisms, including Bacillus anthracis,
			 and for this last work, presented as thesis for the degree of Doctor of
			 Medicine (MD) in 1878, he was awarded a gold medal.</p> 
		  <p>At the end of the Summer term in 1878 he returned to Edinburgh and
			 became a lecturer in Anatomy in the extra-academical School of Medicine. Two
			 months later he was appointed Professor of Natural History at the University of
			 Aberdeen. In the same year he founded a small marine zoological station near
			 Aberdeen - the first of its kind in Great Britain. After three years in
			 Aberdeen (<date type="chairspan" normal="1879/1882">1879-1882</date>), Cossar
			 Ewart was appointed to the Chair of Natural History at Edinburgh (<date
			 normal="1882/1927" type="chairspan">1882-1927</date>), where he carried out
			 notable experiments in animal breeding and hybridization, disproving the theory
			 of telegony (the supposed influence of a previous sire on the progeny of the
			 same mother born to other sires). The period he spent at Edinburgh was a period
			 of great expansion both in the teaching of zoology and in the range of research
			 in the subject. Cossar Ewart was instrumental in reorganising the class of
			 practical zoology, and further developed teaching and research in his
			 Department by introducing lectureships in the core subjects of embryology
			 (<date normal="1885" type="chairdate">1885</date>), invertebrate zoology (<date
			 normal="1901" type="chairdate">1901</date>), and heredity and genetics (<date
			 normal="1910" type="chairdate">1910</date>), to which Arthur Darbishire was
			 appointed. </p> 
		  <p>In 1882 Cossar Ewart became Scientific Member of the Fishery Board
			 for Scotland, and over the next seven years he wrote several reports and papers
			 on fisheries, including the natural history of the herring. During the period 
			 <date normal="1888/1895" type="inclusive">1888-1895</date> he then
			 wrote the series of well-known papers on the electric organ of the skate. From
			 his research he proved that the electric organ of the skate was a developing
			 not a degenerating structure.</p> 
		  <p>In about 
			 <date normal="1895" type="single" certainty="uncertain">1895</date>
			 Cossar Ewart began his work in animal breeding in which he devised experiments
			 to explore some of the problems of cross breeding and inbreeding, on reversion
			 and on telegony. The best known of these were those in which mares of various
			 breeds were crossed with a Burchell's zebra stallion. Cossar Ewart then
			 presented the results of his investigations in the volume entitled the
			 <bibref><title>Penycuick Experiments</title></bibref> (<date
			 normal="1999" type="publication">1899</date>), which garnered much critical
			 acclaim. The zebra hybrids also received a lot of attention when they were
			 exhibited at the Royal Agricultural Society's Show in York in 
			 <date normal="1900" type="single">1900</date>.</p> 
		  <p>A few years later Cossar Ewart turned his attention to the study of
			 the sequence and structure of different types of penguin feathers which he was
			 able to undertake at the Royal Zoological Park in Edinburgh, the results of
			 which he published in a paper in 
			 <date normal="1921" type="single">1921</date>.</p> 
		  <p> The (Royal) Zoological Society of Scotland was founded in 
			 <date type="single" normal="1909">1909</date> and from its inception
			 the University of Edinburgh had close ties with the Society and one of its
			 first vice-presidents was Cossar Ewart. These strong links have been maintained
			 to the present day, with staff at the University serving on several of the
			 Royal Zoological Society's committees.</p>
