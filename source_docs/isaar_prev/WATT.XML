		  <p>James Watt was born in Greenock in 
			 <date normal="1736" type="single">1736</date>. In his late teens Watt
			 went to London to learn to be a mathematical and philosophical instrument
			 maker, and upon his return to Glasgow he got a job making instruments with the
			 University of Glasgow, who gave him accommodation and a workshop. In 
			 <date normal="1763" type="single">1763</date> John Anderson (<date
			 type="life-span" normal="1726/1796">1726-1796</date>) asked him to repair an
			 early steam engine he had acquired. This early model, known as a Newcomen
			 engine, was very inefficient, wasting a lot of time and fuel. Two years later,
			 he discovered the reason for the waste of power and hit upon the idea of
			 condensing the steam in a separate vessel. This removed the need for heating
			 and cooling, making the engine faster, safer, and more fuel-efficient. In 
			 <date normal="1769" type="single">1769</date> he patented his steam
			 engine.</p> 
		  <p> Between 
			 <date normal="1775/1800" type="inclusive">1775-1800</date> Watt was
			 in partnership with Matthew Boulton (<date normal="1728/1809"
			 type="life-span">1728-1809</date>), a Birmingham engineer, producing engines
			 based on Watt's new model, at Soho Engineering Works in Birmingham. Engineers
			 from all the industrialised countries flocked to see their factories. Watt's
			 engines were initially used for pumping water from Cornish tin and copper
			 mines. Later, the new cotton mills, which had been built near fast-flowing
			 rivers to take advantage of water power, almost all switched to steam.
			 Gradually, mills began to move toward the centres of population. At first,
			 steam power was used mainly for spinning, but eventually weaving was also
			 powered by steam engine. By 
			 <date normal="1819" type="death">1819</date>, the year of Watt's
			 death, there were 18 steam weaving factories in Glasgow, with 2800 looms.</p> 
		  <p>Apart from his steam research, which he originally carried out in
			 the grounds of Kinneil House near Linlithgow, Watt was involved in many other
			 projects. He solved the problem of how to convert the up-and-down piston
			 movement to rotary movement (so that engines could power looms, bellows, and
			 other mechanical devices), he created the term "horsepower", and also invented
			 the rev. counter, a machine for copying sculpture, and a letter copying press
			 (a very early photocopier!) In 
			 <date normal="1882" type="single">1882</date>, 63 years after Watt's
			 death, the British Association gave his name to the unit of electrical power -
			 and today James Watt's name is to be found written on almost every light bulb
			 in the world.</p>

			 frequently with scientific men in France, and Antoine Laurent Lavoisier and
			 Comte Claude Louis Berthollet (<date normal="1748/1822"
			 type="life-span">1748-1822</date>) were among his closest acquaintances.</p>
