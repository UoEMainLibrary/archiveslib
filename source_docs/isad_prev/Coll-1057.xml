		<head>Administrative/Biographical History</head> 
		<p>Alan William Greenwood was born on 29 June 1897, in Melbourne,
		  Australia. He was educated at Wesley College and then entered Melbourne
		  University in 1915. During the First World War he served with the Australian
		  Imperial Forces in Palestine. In 1920 he graduated with the degree of B.Sc. in
		  Chemistry and Zoology. In 1921 he took the degree of M.Sc., and then in 1922
		  undertook work in cytology.</p> 
		<p>In 1923, Greenwood went abroad, coming to Britain, and intended
		  working at Cambridge - but came to Edinburgh to the Animal Breeding Research
		  Department on the advice of Professor Cossar Ewart.</p> 
		<p>In 1925, Greenwood graduated with degree of Ph.D. (Edinburgh), and in
		  1931 took the degree of D.Sc. (Melbourne). His Edinburgh thesis was submitted
		  in three papers, on sex studies in the fowl and on the growth rate in
		  hypophysectomised axolotls, and were entitled 
		<title>Gonad grafts in embryonic chicks and their relation to sexual
		  differentiation</title>, 
		<title>Gonad grafts in the fowl</title>, and 
		<title>The growth rate in hypophysectomised salamander larvae</title>.
		Between these two degrees, in 1927, he made an extensive tour of universities
		and research laboratories in Poland. In 1931 he went to the USA to study at
		Columbia and at Chicago. In 1932, he was awarded the Keith Prize from the Royal
		Society of Edinburgh for his contribution to the study of the biology of the
		fowl.</p> 
		<p>From 1928, Greenwood had been engaged largely on investigations into
		  the inheritance of productive qualities. He had published widely on the
		  domestic fowl.</p> 
		<p>Latterly, Dr. Alan William Greenwood was Director of the Poultry
		  Research Centre, Edinburgh University.</p>
