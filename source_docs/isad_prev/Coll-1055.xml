		<head>Administrative/Biographical History</head> 
		<p>Eric Olof Lundholm was born in 1915 in Modderfontein, in the
		  Transvaal, South Africa. His parents were Goesta Lundholm, a chemist, and Dr.
		  Agnes Barr Auchencloss. His great-grandfather, Olof Lundholm, was personal
		  attendant to Carl XIV Johan, King of Sweden. As Master of the Household he
		  served the Swedish Court for 68 years and throughout the reigns of four Swedish
		  monarchs, and was awarded the Vasa Order in 1864. Lundholm's grandfather, Carl
		  Olof Lundholm, a noted engineer, was an associate of Alfred Nobel who asked him
		  to manage his new fulminate of mercury plant at Westquarter, near Falkirk, in
		  Scotland, and was then appointed Manager of Nobel's Explosive Company at
		  Ardeer, near Stevenston. Goesta Lundholm, earlier a chemist with the British
		  South African Explosive Co. Ltd. became Superintendent at the ICI Detonator
		  Factory at Westquarter. </p> 
		<p>The young Eric Olof Lundholm received his early education in
		  Modderfontein, and then with the family's move to Scotland, his secondary
		  education was provided at Falkirk High School. Glasgow University followed, and
		  in 1937 he graduated B.Sc. First Class Honours in Geology, and became Baxter
		  Demonstrator in Geology. In 1939 he enrolled at Glasgow Medical School but
		  after the outbreak of war he was called up in August 1940 into a chemical
		  warfare training battalion, Royal Engineers. He was commissioned in June 1941
		  and posted to a Boring Unit R.E., and saw service in the Middle East, first
		  unblocking oil wells at Kirkuk, cemented by the Allies against possible German
		  advance, thereafter on water supply development by bore-holes.</p>
		<p>On demobilisation in February 1946, Lundholm resumed his medical
		  course, graduating M.B. Ch.B. at Glasgow University in July 1950. One year as
		  House Surgeon and House Physician was followed by specialising in Psychiatry,
		  and he took the Diploma in Psychological Medicine (DPM) of the Royal College of
		  Physicians and Surgeons of Ireland in 1953. In April 1960, Eric Olof Lundholm
		  married Dorothy Vida Henning, B.A. M.Sc. (Geography, Trinity College, Dublin)
		  who was an Assistant Lecturer in Geography at Glasgow University and
		  subsequently became a Medical Artist, working in the Anatomy Department,
		  illustrating professorial writings.</p>
		<p>Dr. Eric Olof Lundholm retired in July 1980 after working in
		  psychiatric hospitals in West and East Scotland with special interests in
		  therapeutic communities, individual and group psychotherapy and psychogeriatric
		  medicine. He lives in Edinburgh.</p>
