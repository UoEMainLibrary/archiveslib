		<head>Administrative/Biographical History</head> 
		<p>Susan Anderson Binnie was born on 19 June 1898, at Lynmill,
		  Avonbridge, Stirlingshire. She was the sister of John Binnie, born in 1894. She
		  was educated at Airdrie Academy, and then from 1915 she studied medicine at
		  Edinburgh University where she was among the first women allowed to study with
		  male medical students. Binnie graduated with the degrees of MB and ChB in the
		  early 1920s. Her brother had also graduated as a doctor, and during the First
		  World War he served on submarines.</p> 
		<p>In the post-War years, John Binnie set up a medical practice in
		  Midcalder and Susan Binnie worked for him in the practice for a short while.
		  She then worked as a pathologist at Bangour Hospital, West Lothian.</p> 
		<p>On 4 July 1925, at Lynmill, Avonbridge, Binnie married Donald Moodie,
		  an artist on the staff of Edinburgh College of Art. As a young married woman
		  with two small children - Kathleen and Margaret - she found it difficult to
		  keep her medical career going, but she was able to undertake a few locums in
		  the Highlands and Islands, on Papa Westray in Orkney, and on Coll, and in
		  Easter Ross. She twice tried to return to medicine full-time but this just
		  wasn't to be.</p> 
		<p>Susan Anderson Binnie (Mrs Susan A. Moodie) died on 27 March 1975, in
		  Edinburgh.</p>
