		<head>Administrative/Biographical History</head> 
		<p>Stanley Eric Francis Booth-Clibborn, Church Missionary Society
		  missionary in Kenya and Bishop of Manchester, was born on 20 October 1924 into
		  the family that founded the Salvation Army. Throughout his life he sought to
		  combine his belief in Christianity with the promotion of social justice and the
		  support of the poor and oppressed. He spent four years in the army, including
		  two in India, then went to Oriel College, Oxford graduating BA (1951) and MA
		  (1956). In 1950 he had studied at Westcott House in Cambridge and in 1952 he
		  was ordained a deacon and a year later a priest. His first posts as a curate
		  were in Sheffield (1952-56) but he was then accepted as a missionary to
		  Kenya.</p> 
		<p>Booth-Clibborn arrived in Africa in 1956 where he was to have varied
		  ecumenical responsibilities included editing 
		<title>Rock</title> and 
		<title>Target</title>, influential church newspapers in East Africa. He
		was especially concerned to promote church unity and the development of the
		African church leadership during the political upheaval around the time of the
		Mau Mau rebellion.</p> 
		<p>On returning to England in 1967 Booth-Clibborn became a minister in
		  Lincoln but was also involved with the International Affairs Department of the
		  British Council of Churches, and his wife Anne (nee Forrester) was Vice-Chair
		  of Christian Aid for a time. He then moved to Cambridge in 1970 spending 9
		  years at St Mary the Great. From 1979 he was Bishop of Manchester and regarded
		  with great affection and respect even by those who disagreed with his with his
		  views, he was, for example, a strong supporter of women's ordination. He
		  retired in 1992 and went, with his wife, to live in Edinburgh. His interest in
		  Africa had continued and the Booth-Clibborns were invited by the National
		  Council of Churches in Kenya (NCCK), in co-operation with Christian Aid, to
		  monitor the 1992 Kenyan elections. The Rt. Rev. Stanley Booth-Clibborn died on
		  6 March 1996. </p>
