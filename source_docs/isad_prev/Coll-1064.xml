		<head>Administrative/Biographical History</head> 
		<p>The psychologist and mathematical physicist Godfrey Hilton Thomson was
		  born on 27 March 1881. He was educated at Rutherford College, Newcastle, and he
		  studied at the Universities of Durham and Strasburg. He was awarded the degrees
		  of B.Sc. 1903, M.Sc. 1906, D.Sc. 1913, and Ph.D. (Strasburg) 1906. Thomson
		  became a Lecturer in Education at Armstrong College (King's College of the
		  University of Durham) in 1909 and was raised to Professor there in 1920. In
		  1923-1924 he was a Visiting Professor at Columbia University, New York.</p> 
		<p> Experiences in Germany (prior to the 1919 Treaty, Strasburg had been
		  German territory), and in the USA, brought him into close contact with
		  educational theory and practice, and he became an authority on intelligence
		  testing. In 1925 became Bell Professor of the Theory, History and Practice of
		  Education at the University of Edinburgh. He was also Director of Moray House
		  College. While at Edinburgh, Walter Ledermann, a young German, became Thomson's
		  private assistant.</p> 
		<p>Walter Ledermann was born in Berlin, 18 March 1911. He left Germany in
		  1934 and came to St. Andrews in Scotland as a research student at the
		  University. He obtained his St. Andrews Ph.D in 1936. In 1937 he became a
		  Lecturer in Dundee and a private assistant to Thomson at the University of
		  Edinburgh. Between 1938 and 1946 he was back at St. Andrews, and in 1940 he was
		  awarded the degree of D.Sc. by the University of Edinburgh, the same year that
		  he had become a British citizen. In 1944 he was elected as a Fellow of the
		  Royal Society of Edinburgh. Throughout the late 1930s and into the 1940s and
		  1950s, professional correspondence between Ledermann and Thomson was
		  maintained.</p> 
		<p>Thomson was knighted in 1949 and was also awarded the Order of Polonia
		  Restituta. He retired in 1951. His publications include 
		<title>The essentials of mental measurement</title> written with Dr.
		William Brown, 
		<title>Instinct, intelligence and character, an educational
		  psychology</title>, 
		<title>A modern philosophy of education</title>, and 
		<title>The geometry of mental measurement</title>. Thomson was also
		involved in the Northumberland mental tests, and the Moray House tests.</p> 
		<p>Sir Godfrey Hilton Thomson died in Edinburgh on 9 February 1955. </p> 
		<p>Ledermann had gone on to become a Lecturer at the University of
		  Manchester in 1946, and he remained there until 1962 when he was appointed
		  Reader at the University of Sussex. At Sussex he was one of the founding
		  members of the School of Physical Sciences, and in 1965 he became Professor of
		  Mathematics. Ledermann retired in 1978. He celebrated his 90th birthday in
		  2001.</p>

		<head>Scope and Content</head> 
		<p>The collection is composed of manuscript and typescript correspondence
		  (largely letters from) Sir Godfrey Thomson between 1937 and 1954. The material
		  includes: sheaf of correspondence (dated Feb. 1937 - Dec. 1937), Thomson to
		  Ledermann / Horst (36 letters/postcards/items); sheaf of correspondence (dated
		  New Years Day 1938 - Dec. 1938), Thomson to Ledermann, and some Ledermann to
		  Thomson, and Bartlett to Thomson (58 letters/postcards/items); and, a sheaf of
		  correspondence (dated 1939 - 1954), Thomson to Ledermann, and Thomson to Herdan
		  (circa 50 letters/postcards/items).</p> 
		<p>The mathematical subjects within the letters range from factorial
		  analysis, pentad criterion, multivariate selection, correlation between
		  estimation and selection, Bartlett's method of estimating factors, boundary
		  conditions, minimum trace and minimum Thorstone rank, tetrad criterion,
		  univariate selection, profile correlations and Thurstone residues, Spearman
		  matrix, and reciprocity of persons and tests. Other topics include: social
		  invitations; advice on articles for journals; lists of books for purchase;
		  correlations between persons; and, tests results.</p> 
		<p>Among the letters too there are occasional off-prints (usually single
		  pages) from academic journals, and transcripts of formulae and estimates.</p>
