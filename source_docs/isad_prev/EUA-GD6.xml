		<p>Edinburgh University Tea Club first met in the Upper Library Hall, Old
		  College, Edinburgh University on 5 November 1920. It emerged at a time when the
		  University was gradually opening itself up to female students. Although a
		  Women's Union had been formed on similar lines to the student Union already
		  existing for men, it was felt that women who were associated with the teaching
		  staff of the University, either directly or through their husbands, would enjoy
		  having a similar opportunity to meet socially. By 1945, the Club had
		  flourishing tennis and badminton sections, an annual golf outing and a club for
		  folk-dancing. There were also children's Christmas parties. In 1966, a flat
		  within Edinburgh University property at Buccleuch Place was made available to
		  the Club where newcomers could become introduced to members and which could act
		  as a focal point for the Club.</p>
