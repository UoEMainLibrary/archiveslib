                searching for the calf for four days ere he<lb/>                
                discovered it. And it was only by stratagem that<lb/>
                he discovered the calf at last. He watched the cow<lb/>
                in the grey dawn of the morning and saw her putting<lb/>
                the calf in concealment for the day.
                </p>
            <p>She put him in a "còs", a grassy nest, at the<lb/>

                <pb id="CW87-28r" n="0028r"/>
                pressed the long grass over him. No human being<lb/>

                enough for the beautiful little hollow which the<lb/>

                giving suck to her calf and hiding it the cow<lb/>
                went away with the rest of the herd and joining<lb/>
