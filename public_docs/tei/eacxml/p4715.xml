            <biogHist>
                <p>Duncan was born to Donald Sinclair and Ann Sinclair née MacLachlan sometime in
                    1806 in Appin, though Kilmore and Kilbride were noted in the 1851 Census only.
                    The first records of him are of his marriage to Mary MacNeil from Mingulay on 14
                    September 1833 at St. Brendan's, Craigston on Barra. In 1841 they were living in
                    Gleann with their three children, John (6), Donald (3) and Niel [sic] (1), and a
                    servant Anne MacKinnon. The family had moved to Berneray by 1851 where Duncan
                    had three acres of land. Of his children it seems that Niel did not survive, but
                    another child, John, had been born. Ten years later, Duncan's family had
                    increased with Andrew (17), Margaret (15), Duncan (8) and Peter (12), together
                    with a servant Marion MacNeil. The family were living in a croft that had no
                    windows according to the Census of the time. By 1871, only the children Donald,
                    Andrew, Margaret, Peter and Duncan were still with their parents, with two
                    servants Flora and John MacKinnon, who were probably brother and sister. Also
                    visiting at the time were Donald MacCrae a crofter and fishermen Donald and
                    Roderick Campbell. </p>
                <p>Duncan Sinclair was not in good health, suffering from chronic bronchitis from
                    which he eventually died from in January 1874 at 5am at the age of 68. His son
                    Andrew Sinclair was the informant.</p>
