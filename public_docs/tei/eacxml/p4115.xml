            <biogHist>
                <p>Christina or Chirsty Macintyre was born the daughter of John Macintyre [Iain
                    Donn], tenant farmer, and Ann or Agne Macintyre née MacGrigor. In her youth she
                    seems to have worked as a servant in the Lowlands – later on in life she is
                    recorded as having both Gaelic and English – but by 1851 she had returned to the
                    thirty-acre family holding in order to assist her widowed mother and her brother
                    Dugald.</p>
                <p>On 21 January 1864 she married Duncan Campbell, lime burner, Achnacroish, son of
                    James Campbell, farmer, and Isabella Campbell née Black. Within a few months,
                    however, tragedy struck. This episode, and its aftermath, she recounted to
                    Alexander Carmichael in some detail nearly twenty years after the event
                    [CW120/50]: a most unusual example of a family catastrophe recorded directly
                    into his field notebooks.</p>
                <p>On 7 August Chirsty’s brother Dugald Macintyre fell ill with typhus fever. Eight
                    days later he was dead. On 5 September her husband Duncan Campbell succumbed to
                    the same illness. ‘Each went out on a Tuesday – 3 weeks between. I dragged both
                    their bodies out &amp; put them in the coffin on the field. &amp; I weak
                    watching them &amp; fighting with them for they came strong &amp; feverish.’
                    [CW120/50]. Two nephews and a cousin also suffered, but survived. ‘I then lay in
                    fear &amp; lay unconscious for 3 weeks &amp; till beg[inning] of spring was
                    weak’ [CW120/50]. During all this time she was expecting a child.</p>
                <p>The Macintyre family was already in arrears after her brother Dugald had lost the
                    money he had made from the sale of a horse while returning from market, three
                    years previously. According to Chirsty, all their cattle and crops were seized
                    and disposed of while she herself was lying ill. All three tenants of Tirfuir
                    were thereupon evicted and removed to Balnagowan, where Chirsty, now a cottar,
                    brought up her son Duncan. The Tirfuir holdings were converted into a grazing
                    park for sheep.</p>
                <p>Alexander Carmichael visited Chirsty Campbell in late August 1883, sometime
                    between Sunday 18 and Thursday 29. He had already visited Lismore in the middle
                    of the month, recording in his field notebook on Wednesday 15. The date is
                    significant: on Monday 13 August the Napier Commission had held a session on the
                    island, and we can be virtually certain that Carmichael was present.</p>
                <p>Carmichael would have heard about the evictions of Tirfuir from three speakers,
                    Firstly, Dugald Carmichael, labourer, Balamaillachean, telling of how ‘[t]he
                    reason given for clearing these townships was that there was fever in the place,
                    and one family got their death in consequence of the fever, and then the other
                    two were turned away’ [Napier Commission, iii, 2331]. Secondly, he would have
                    heard the account of Dugald Buchanan, quarryman, Balnagowan, himself one of
                    those evicted, who had given Chirsty shelter in a byre [ibid., 2333–5]. Finally,
                    he would also have heard the local land agent, John Fraser Sim of Oban,
                    defending the actions of his predecessor Mr Gregorson from Dugald Buchanan’s
                    charges [ibid., 2354, 2356]. Alexander Carmichael’s recording from Chirsty
                    Campbell the poignant personal account of her eviction, together with the
                    financial losses she incurred, is clearly intended to be a contribution to the
                    commission’s evidence, though it does not appear in its final report.</p>
                <p>Given references to Tirfuir on fos.10v and 18, it is probable that Carmichael
                    recorded a substantial amount of Lismore tradition from Chirsty Campbell both
                    before and after her personal narrative, beginning with an unascribed item about
                    the Rev. Archibald Campbell of Lismore (c. 1692–1752), telling how ministers of
                    the island up until the early nineteenth century had Eilean Dubh and part of
                    Tirfuir in their glebe [CW120/34]. Subsequent items include historical tales and
                    anecdotes, family history, local idioms, and information about island
                    antiquities.</p>
                <p>Christina Campbell died in 1896, of a weak heart and bronchitis and her son
                    Duncan, now employed as a gardener, is recorded as the witness on her death
                    certificate.</p>
