            <biogHist>
                <p>Donald MacGregor or Macgrigor was born on the Isle of Lismore, the son of Dugald
                    MacGregor and Janet MacGregor née Black. As an agricultural labourer and then a
                    stonemason, profiting from the general improvement of local housing stock during
                    this period, MacGregor appears to have led a rather peripatetic life between
                    Lismore and the mainland on either side of Loch Linnhe, while ten years later he
                    was back with his family - his parents, three brothers (John, schoolmaster,
                    Robert, boatbuilder, and James, young scholar) and a sister ( scholar) - at
                    Baligarve in Lismore.</p>
                <p>In 1861 Donald macGregor was working as a stone quarrier at Druimavuic in the
                    parish of Arnchattan, at the head of Loch Creran, lodging, apparently in a
                    single room, with four other Lismore men: a Hugh MacGregor, possibly a brother,
                    and three Carmichaels, Archibald, Donald, and Alexander, who may have been
                    relatives of Alexander Carmichael himself. Ten years later he was back in Morven
                    at Be-Ach or Beitheach near the township of Clounlaid where he had stayed thirty
                    years previously, this time recorded as living in 'McGregor's House' working as
                    a mason with another two Lismore men, Archibald MacCorquodale and the widower
                    Duncan Carmichael. In 1881 Donald MacGregor, mason, was living once more in
                    Baligarve, Lismore, with his sisters Janet and Helen, and young nephew John.
                    Janet was the unmarried mother of Captain Hugh Anderson (c.1839-1909), commander
                    of ships for the Nobel Explosives Company and a very capable bard.</p>
                <p>In August 1883, two days after Napier Commission had sat in the Baptist Church at
                    Bachuil, Alexander Carmichael met 'Donald Macgrigor, Bailegarbh', and wrote down
                    a series of local history legends, mainly about the notorious Sir Donald
                    Campbell of Ầird, Domhnall Dubh nan Aird (d. 1651), illegitimate son of Sir
                    JohnCampbell of Cawdor [CW120/5]. The folklorist may well have gone back to
                    interview MacGregor the following day: after the transcription of the gravestone
                    of five of his siblings who had died young, there is note on conglomerate stone
                    followed by a number of other unascribed historical legends and notes
                    [CW120/14].</p>
                <p>Donald MacGregor, pauper formerly a mason, died at Killandrist in November 1887
                    of chronic bronchitis and emphysema. His death certificate was signed by his
                    nephew Donald MacGregor.</p>
