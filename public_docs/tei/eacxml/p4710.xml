            <biogHist>
                <p>Mary MacDonald was the youngest daughter of Roderick MacDonald, fisherman, and
                    Annie née MacNeil. Her brothers and sisters were John (born c. 1829), Rory (born
                    c. 1832), Jannet (born c. 1830), Neil (born c. 1835) and they lived on the
                    Island of Mingulay. By the 1861 Census she was working as a domestic servant
                    with the John and Anne MacNeil and family on Bernaray.</p>
                <p>In 1876 she married widower Donald Boyd from Gleann on the 6th of January in
                    Craigston, Barra. By 1881 they had settled in Castlebay, where Donald Boyd was
                    crofting. They had a son Michael born c. 1874 and they were all living in a
                    house with two rooms with windows. By 1891 they had moved to Gleann and had had
                    a daughter Ann (born c. 1879) who appears not to have been recorded in the
                    previous Census. Their son Michael is not recorded with them. </p>
                <p>Mary died in September 1915 at 28 Shore Street, Inverness, though her usual
                    residence is recorded as being in Castlebay, Barra. She suffered from
                    haemplegia, and exhaustion as certified by the medical attendant D.J. Kelly. Her
                    daughter Patience signed the certificate.</p>
                <p>Carmichael recorded a song from Mary and her friend Mary Campbell.</p>
