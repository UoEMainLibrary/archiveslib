            <biogHist>
                <p>John Livingston, ‘Am Muillear Mòr’, corn miller, Portnacroish, Appin, was the son
                    of Colin Livingston and Catherine née MacGregor. He was baptised on the 7
                    October 1810. John Livingston claimed descent from the Livingstons of Achnacree
                    in Benderloch; among his near relatives was Dr David Livingstone (1813–73)
                    [CW102-121. John Livingston’s grandfather had the rent of Creag Churalain from
                    the Campbells of Barcaldine, probably because he ‘went with Coilin Rua[dh]’: in
                    other words, he was one of the Campbell followers brought in by Colin of Glenure
                    (murdered 14 May 1752) to the forfeited Ardsheil estate in the aftermath of the
                    Forty-Five [CW102-121]. John’s father Colin, himself a miller and probably named
                    in honour of his own father’s patron, settled in Inverfolla, close by
                    Invernahyle, around 1800.</p>
                <p>According to John’s own account, Colin Livingston remained in Inverfolla for 31
                    years, and his son for another 13 [CW102-121]. Although the date of Colin’s
                    retiral appears to make perfect sense, given that in 1831 John would just have
                    attained his majority – note also that he married Mary MacKichan, probably from
                    Oban, at the end of that year, suggesting that he now had the income to keep a
                    household and family – the son does not seem immediately to have followed the
                    father as Inverfolla miller. In the 1841 census Colin, now a widower, was
                    recorded as a crofter living in Taychreggan with his son John, a mason, his wife
                    Mary, and their five children. John does not appear at Inverfolla until the 1851
                    census, when he is recorded as a Meal Grinder, assisted by his brother-in-law
                    John. In 1861, however, he is a mason once more, living at Portnacroish on the
                    Ballachulish Road with his wife, two unmarried daughters, and a four-year-old
                    niece from Perth. He would remain in Portnacroish for the rest of his life.</p>
                <p>Ten years later the couple were living in the same area, on the Achasragain Road,
                    with an unmarried daughter and a three-year-old granddaughter Christina L.
                    MacPhee from Edinburgh. Christina was still living with her grandparents in
                    1881, together with a fifteen-year-old grandson from Ardchattan, Nicol Campbell,
                    and in 1891 too. By this time, John Livingston was recorded solely as a crofter.
                    Nobody in the household, apparently next door to the Post Office in
                    Portnacroish, spoke English. Christina was also the witness for her
                    grandfather’s death certificate: John Livingston, corn miller (retired) and
                    crofter, died of heart failure on 30 March 1895.</p>
                <p>It is likely that Alexander Carmichael was directed to Livingston by Donald
                    MacColl, Fasnacloich (‘Am Brocair’), after he recorded earlier that day the
                    particulars of an eighteenth-century brooch inherited by MacColl’s wife from her
                    grandmother Mary MacColl at Callart. Carmichael wrote down from the old miller
                    details of the whereabouts of seven other curios and heirlooms, mostly connected
                    with the Appin gentry. Livingston went on to give his own commentary to certain
                    of Donald MacColl’s narratives about the district recently recorded by
                    Carmichael, adding details such as the fact that Féill Churalain, St Cyril’s
                    Fair, was held on 16 March: ‘Cuirealan an-diugh is Pàdraig a-màireach’
                    [CW102-121]. </p>
