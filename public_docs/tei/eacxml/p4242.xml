            <biogHist>
                <p>Ann MacLellan was the daughter of John (born c. 1757), farmer and tailor, and
                    Christina née Macmillan (born c. 1767). She was born c. 1808, seemingly the
                    second of five children, two other daughters called Mary, and two sons, John and
                    Angus.</p>
                <p>In 1847 Ann married Hector MacIsaac (c. 1797–1878), joiner, the son of Roderick
                    and Ann née Macintyre. Roderick was a tenant at Lianacuidh in Iochdar. The
                    couple, then recorded as being at Bòrnais Iochdrach, had one child, Marion, born
                    23 November 1848. By 1861 the family are living at Àird na Mòine, Iochdar, and
                    ten years later they are recorded at Àird Mhór (at present-day number 4) in the
                    same district.</p>
                <p>Hector MacIsaac was one of the most celebrated <span>seanchaidhean</span> of the
                    island in his day, possessing a rich store of Fenian narratives, most of which
                    he had learnt from the itinerant catechist Roderick MacQuien, Ruairidh Ruadh.
                    Alexander Carmichael had been recording from him since July 1865, and it is
                    clear that a rapport had been established between the young collector and the
                    older couple.</p>
                <p>Although a relatively frequent visitor to the household, Alexander Carmichael
                    apparently recorded Anna MacIsaac on just two occasions. Firstly, during 1865 he
                    seems to have taken down a version of MacLeod’s Lullaby, <span>Tàladh
                        MhicLeòid</span> [<span localType="mods-titleinfo">Carmina Gadelica</span>
                    v, 214–15, 226, 227]. Secondly, he recorded at greater length from her on 16
                    October 1867. The original field notes from these two occasions have not
                    survived, but later transcripts of the second, including a reconstruction of her
                    conversation to him [CW87/22-28], suggest that she began by presenting
                    Carmichael with a <span>Eàrna Mhoire</span> or Molucca Bean, a prized family
                    heirloom cherished for its powers in protecting women in childbirth. Carmichael
                    was shortly to marry Mary Frances Macbean, and it is likely that the bean was
                    the old lady’s wedding gift to the new couple. Along with it, Anna MacIsaac
                    recited a charm to be recited thrice while the child was being born.</p>
                <p>Carmichael’s interest was clearly picqued, as Ann MacIsaac went on to give the
                    collector a charm she described – possibly in error – as <span>An
                        Eàrr-Thalmhainn</span> or yarrow charm [cf. <span localType="mods-titleinfo"
                        >CG</span> i, 68–9; it is interesting that Carmichael ascribed, or probably
                    misascribed, to Ann MacIsaac a yarrow charm not in extant manuscripts, <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">CG</span> ii, 94–5], followed by a series of four
                    charms to protect cattle: <span>Eòlas an Tairbhein</span>, probably against
                    warble fly; <span>Eòlas a’ Bhun-Deirg</span>, against Red Water Disease;
                        <span>Eòlas na Ruaidh</span>, against rose or erysipelas; and <span>Eòlas an
                        t-Sniòmh</span>, the familiar ‘bone to bone’ charm – the implication being,
                    of course, that she was an active charmer. By the time the recording session had
                    ended, Alexander Carmichael had noted six items, almost as many vernacular charm
                    texts as had been written down in Scottish Gaelic during the previous three
                    centuries.</p>
                <p>Despite the importance of the items which she had given Carmichael, the only
                    other reference to Ann MacIsaac in the collection is a marginal note naming her
                    and her husband, dated 16 December 1874 [CW380 fo.90v].</p>
                <p>Ann MacIsaac outlived her husband, who died of old age on 11 July 1878. In the
                    1881 census she is described as living alone as a pauper in her single-roomed
                    house in Àird Mhòr. There she died alone two years later, on 29 January 1883, of
                    ‘old age &amp; infirmity’. Her death certificate was not certified, but was
                    signed by her daughter, now Marion MacQuarrie. </p>
