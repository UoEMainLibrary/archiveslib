            <biogHist>
                <p>Catherine MacColl was the daughter of Hugh or E&#x00F2;ghan MacColl, farmer, and
                    Christina MacColl née MacColl. According to her own account, her father farmed
                    Invernahyle, in the parish of Appin. Catherine would spend her life living in
                    various townships on the north shore of Loch Creran. Around 1810 Catherine
                    married Donald MacNiven (c.1788-1856), farmer and shoemaker, son of Duncan
                    MacNiven, mariner, and Ann MacNiven née Lennox. There were apparently seven
                    children altogether from the marriage: Duncan (born c. 1811); Christie (born c.
                    1813); Ann (born c. 1815); John (born c. 1822); Hugh (born c. 1825); Donald
                    (born c. 1831) and Catherine (born c. 1834). </p>
                <p>In the 1841 census Catherine MacNiven is recorded as living with her husband,
                    described as a farmer, their four youngest children, and the eighty-year-old Ann
                    MacNiven, probably her mother-in-law, near Invernahyle in the township of
                    Ardnaclach on the north shore of Loch Creran. Ten years later, still in
                    Ardnaclach, Donald MacNiven appears as a shoemaker, as does his son John, while
                    Hugh, Donald and Catherine herself are described as farm labourers. </p>
                <p>On 22 March 1856 Donald MacNiven, of Rudha Garbh beside Ardnaclach, died of
                    dropsy. His widow Catherine was still living there at the time of the census
                    five years later, together with her son Donald, now a gamekeeper, and her
                    daughters Ann and Catherine. By 1871 the by now aged Catherine had moved once
                    more, going with her youngest daughter Catherine to live at her bachelor son
                    John's farm on Shian Road, next door to Donald the gamekeeper who had married
                    Miss Nicolas Grieve in 1862. Ten years later, in 1881, John MacNiven had taken
                    on the lease of Woodhall Farmhouse, where he was living with the two Catherines,
                    mother and daughter, as well as one farm servant. </p>
                <p>Alexander Carmichael spoke to Catherine MacNiven some time between Tuesday 23
                    September and Wednesday 1 October 1884. Three unascribed tales connected with
                    Muckairn recorded during this week are unlikely to be from Catherine. What
                    Catherine MacNiven evidently did tell Carmichael are further details concerning
                    the local tutelary saint of Appin, Curalan or Cyril, concerning whom he had
                    already recorded material from Donald MacColl the previous year, as well as the
                    mysterious local battle supposedly fought in the distant past at the saint's
                    hill of Creag Churalain [CW120/255]. </p>
                <p>Catherine MacNiven died at Woodhall of senile decay on 7 February 1890. Her son
                    John signed the death certificate. Although her age is recorded as 102, it may
                    be that she was not quite a centenarian at the time of her death. </p>
