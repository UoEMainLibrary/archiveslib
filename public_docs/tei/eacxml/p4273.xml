            <biogHist>
                <p>Marion MacNeil was the daughter of Alexander MacNeil (born c. 1801 in Barra), and
                    Mary née MacDougall (born c. 1799 in South Uist). She was born on 16 January
                    1843, and baptised nine days later. The Census of 1851 has her aged 8 and living
                    with her father and mother and elder brother John aged 16 in Glen [Gleann] on
                    Barra. Her father was an agricultural labourer who later became a fisherman. By
                    the time of the 1861 Census, they had moved to Kentangaval, where another
                    sister, Mary, older than Marion by 10 years, was listed, and who may have been
                    elsewhere during the 1851 Census. Also listed is a grand daughter Mary MacKinnon
                    aged 6. 10 years later the family are still in Kentangaval, and Mary (listed as
                    Isabella in the Census) and Marion are both working as domestic servants. Mary
                    MacKinnon is still there but she is noted as a lodger, rather than
                    granddaughter, aged 16 and still at school, and Alexander Keny a grandson was
                    visiting from Greenock.</p>
                <p>On 6 June 1876, Marion married widower and crofter Murdoch MacLean (born c. 1833)
                    from Borve to where she moves with him and his family. Murdoch already had three
                    children: John (born c. 1865), Mary (born c. 1871) and Christina (born c. 1872).
                    By the 1881 Census, Marion had provided Murdoch with three further children:
                    Michael (born c. 1878), Mary (born c. 1879) and Angus who was only just a month
                    old. The house she was staying was also slightly bigger as it had two rooms with
                    windows. By 1891 all except two children, Mary and Angus, have moved on, and
                    they are both still at school. The family indicate that they only speak Gaelic.
                    Ten years later, only Angus is left out of the children, and now aged 19, he
                    works as a general labourer and can speak both Gaelic and English. The 1901
                    Census indicates that their house is in the town’s high road and has three rooms
                    with windows.</p>
                <p>Carmichael met Marion several times. On 2 December 1870, when she was in
                    Kentangaval, she recited two songs to him 'Is Mise Bhean Bhoc', or 'Oran Iain
                    oig Mhic 'Ic Neill Bharraich', and 'Mac 'Ic ailean'. A later meeting on 25
                    September 1872 she sang 'Cumha Mhic an Toisich' [MacIntosh's Lament] to him; and
                    sometime during 1901 they met again and she provided more songs, such as 'An
                    Saibhir Sanntach' [An Saoibhir Sanntach, The Greedy Rich Man]. Carmichael's
                    notebook for 1901 refers to her several times.</p>
                <p>Marion died in August 1927 from senile decay in Borve, the widow of Murdoch
                    MacLean. No medical attendant was present and her son Michael witnessed the
                    death certificate.</p>
