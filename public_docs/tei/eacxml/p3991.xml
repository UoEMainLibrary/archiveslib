            <biogHist>
                <p>Anthony Campbell was born to James Campbell, road labourer and crofter, and
                    Christina née MacNeil of Gorstan. The 1841 Census has James and his family
                    living in Glen with Anthony and his three brothers Donald (7), Pol (5) and John
                    (3); and two sisters Mary (12) and Marion (9). In 1851, the Census records the
                    family in Tradestown, Nairn where James and his son Anthony work as road
                    labourers. The Census records a Sally, aged 20, who may also be Mary, and
                    another daughter named Erick, aged 6. Not all the children are recorded with the
                    parents and may still be on Barra. </p>
                <p>Anthony married Flora MacMillan in February 1855, though both born on Barra they
                    were married in Inverness Catholic Chapel, where Anthony is recorded as living
                    in Little Kildrummie, a farm steading a little to the south west of Nairn, and
                    Flora living in Nairn; Anthony was 24, Flora 16 years of age. By the next Census
                    of 1861, Anthony and Flora had returned to Barra and now had two children,
                    Duncan (5) and Ann (2), residing in Kentangaval. Anthony was now a crofter. At
                    the time of the 1871 Census for Kentangaval, Anthony was occupied as a seaman,
                    with his wife Flora being recorded as having no professional occupation. They
                    had by this time five children, Duncan (12), Ann (10), Angus (8), Roderick (6)
                    and John (4), the first three children were now at school. The 1881 Census still
                    has Anthony living in Kentangaval with his wife, and with a further two
                    children, Donald (11) and Mary (6). Duncan, Angus and Roderick (Rory) had
                    followed their father into fishing, with his daughter, Ann, being a general
                    servant, and the two youngest being at school.</p>
                <p>The Kentangaval Census of 1891 indicates that Anthony is both a fisherman and a
                    crofter. His eldest son, Duncan is not recorded, nor is Ann, presumably married,
                    but the other children are still there, together with a schoolgirl Marion
                    MacMillian, from Glasgow. The household, by the 1901 Census, has decreased
                    further with only the sons Roderick and Donald still living there and working as
                    fishermen. Additionally, Anthony and Flora's grandson, Donald (13) is staying
                    with them at this point. During their years in Kentangaval, the family have
                    stayed in a two roomed house with windows, and the Censuses of 1891 and 1901
                    have recorded the family as being able to speak both Gaelic and English, though
                    Flora indicates only Gaelic in 1901. Three years later in 1904 Anthony Campbell
                    died,  the cause of death is unknown and his son Donald signed the register.</p>
