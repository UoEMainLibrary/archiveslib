            <biogHist>
                <p>The son of Alexander Robertson of Straloch in Perthshire, John Robertson or Reid
                    was educated at the University of Edinburgh and received a commission in Lord
                    Loudon's regiment of Highlanders in 1745; he subsequently adopted his mother's
                    maiden name as his own, she being a Reid of Straloch. He served with the
                    regiment on the Hanoverian side during the 1745 rebellion, and afterwards in the
                    Netherlands, Martinique, and British North America. He purchased some 35,000
                    acres in Vermont, which were seized by settlers from New England in 1774, and he
                    lost his claim to them at the outbreak of the American War of Independence in
                    1776.</p>
                <p>He returned to London, where he was promoted to the rank of General, and died in
                    1807. A good flautist and composer, especially of music for wind bands, his
                    best-remembered tune today is 'In the Garb of Old Gaul'. </p>
                <p>In spiter of his losses he left a sum of over £50,000 for the founding of a Chair
                    of Music at the University of Edinburgh, the money to be further applied to the
                    purchase of a library or for any other proper purpose. The Chair was established
                    in 1839, after the death of his daughter who had a life-interest in the estate,
                    and £400 per annum was put to the purchase of rare and costly books for the
                    University Library. These have included early printed and finely illustrated
                    books and mediaeval manuscripts. Originally these were shelved in the Reid Room
                    in Old College, which was reserved for the use of professors and senior
                    lecturers. This was the first fund available to the Library for purchasing
                    historical research volumes that were not simply textbooks. </p>
