            <biogHist>
                <p>Donald MacDonald was the son of Alexander MacDonald (1832–1872), farmer (or
                    rather tenant) in Snaoiseabhal, South Uist, and his wife Catherine MacDonald née
                    MacDonald (1831–75). The official record states that he was born on 4 September
                    1862, while the church register from Ardkenneth records his birthday as 28
                    August; he was baptised on 14 September. It is noteworthy that his grandfather
                    Duncan told Carmichael that Donald was born on <span>Latha Fhéill
                    Mìcheil</span>, 29 September! [CW107/43].</p>
                <p>Donald’s father Alexander, Alasdair Ruadh, had the patronymic Alasdair ’ic
                    Dhomhnaill ’ic Dhomhnaill ’ic Iain ’ic Dhomhnaill ’ic Iain ’ic Iain ’ic
                    Raghnaill Bhòrnais. This Ranald will have been the first of the Bornish line,
                    living in the later part of the sixteenth century [A. &amp; A. MacDonald, <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">The Clan Donald</span> (3 vols, Inverness,
                    1896–1904), 258–9]: the family were known as Sliochd Iain ’ic Raghnaill after
                    his son. Through his paternal grandmother Ann MacEachen Donald was related twice
                    to Marshal Étienne Jacques Joseph Alexandre MacDonald (1765–1840), the Duke of
                    Tarentum: her father, Alexander MacEachen (d. 1835), the last tacksman of his
                    line of Tobha Beag, was the son of John of Tobha Beag, the brother of the
                    Marshal’s father Neil MacEachen; he was also supposedly the grandson of a
                    brother of Alexander’s grandmother through his paternal Bornish line, though a
                    generation may have been omitted here.</p>
                <p>Donald’s mother Catherine was the daughter of the <span>seanchaidh</span> Duncan
                    MacDonald (c. 1787–1873), Donnchadh an Tàilleir. The couple were married on 25
                    February 1862. There were three other daughters of the marriage: Mary
                    (1865–1954), Ann (b. 1867), and Margaret (b. 1869). Mary, Màiri nighean Alasdair
                    Ruaidh, was known for her repertoire of stories and songs, especially waulking
                    songs [see K. C. Craig (ed.), <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Òrain Màiri
                        nighean Alasdair</span> (Glasgow, 1949)].</p>
                <p>Alexander Carmichael recorded from Donald MacDonald while he was in the home of
                    his grandfather Duncan. It is unclear whether he was living with him at the
                    time, though this is certainly the case by the 1871 census. Whatever was the
                    case, Carmichael did not record Donald on the first day he interviewed his
                    grandfather, 6 April 1869. The following day, however, the six year old Donald
                    was introduced to Carmichael by his grandfather: ‘He can rep[ea]t correctly all
                    this Taladh Iain Mhuideartaich [del: Tormaid] Mac mhic ic Ailein – Bhean
                    leasaich an stop – Sir Alastar og thig on chaol, Laoi[dh] na Buileartaich,
                    Laoi[dh] Fhraoich[,] Dun Mhic Iain ic Iain &amp;c &amp;c’ [CW107/43].</p>
                <p>Donald began by singing a lengthy version of <span>Tàladh Iain
                        Mhùideartaich</span> [CW107/43], then, probably, the quern song ‘Beil a
                    Chailleach a’ Bhrà’ [CW107/44]. Carmichael subsequently wrote down from him the
                    text of the Fenian ballad <span>Laoidh a’ Mhuileartaich</span> [CW107/46], and a
                    lament ‘do Thormaid Mac Mhic ic Ailein’ [CW107/48, for a Norman son of MacDonald
                    of Clan Ranald who had died of yellow fever while studying in France – possibly
                    the mysterious son of Ranald (1692–1766) recorded in <span>Clan Donald</span>
                    iii as having studied law in Glasgow, although ‘[n]othing further is known of
                    him’ [A. &amp; A. MacDonald, <span>The Clan Donald</span> (3 vols, Inverness,
                    1896–1904), 235]. All of these were learnt from his grandfather. A further
                    conversation took place about Easter Eggs (Easter having taken place the week
                    before) [CW107/50], before the boy recited the Fenian ballad <span>Laoidh
                        Fhraoich</span> [CW107/51], then finished off with the hymn <span>Laoidh
                        Chrìosd</span> [CW107/52].</p>
                <p>Twenty years later Carmichael was to reminisce about his meeting with ‘this
                    wonderful child of song modesty and memory’ [CW172]:</p>
                <p>‘The only difficulty experienced with this boy was childlike, his disposition to
                    gambol about with his companions. There were a kitten, a pup, and a lamb in the
                    house and every now and then these three and the boy rose and had a frolic on
                    the floor together. The boy's grandfather Donl mac an taillear, Donald son [of]
                    the tailor – a nice old man sat in a corner enveloped in friendly peat smoke and
                    now and again scolded the boy in a friendly way for not attending to the
                    gentleman. At last fairly tired and done up these four playful delightful and
                    frolicsome creatures lay down on the floor beside the friendly fire of peat and
                    fell fast asleep. A shaggy little six-horned sheep an equally shagg[y]
                    symmetrical black calf and a sturdy ragged little foal all by times and [supra:
                    sometimes] together looked in and sniffed the nestling group beside the fire.’
                    [CW172]</p>
                <p>‘One of the most delightful [reciters] was a boy Donald Macdonald son of a small
                    crofter at Snaoisvall South Uist. He was then nearly six years of age, bare
                    footed bare headed with a scant kilt out of which he had [del: over] grown a
                    year or two [supra: before]. … The boys grandfather was sitting upon a bench in
                    a dark corner and I was sitting upon the bench near him. The boy was sitting
                    upon the base clay floor before the bright peat fire but more often rolling upon
                    the floor with one arm round the neck a half grown lamb and another arm bound
                    the neck of a half grown collie dog. The three lay stretched side by side the
                    boy in the middleand had a little sleep as was their wont after tiring
                    themselves out in play. Every now and then a half grown pig would come and look
                    in from turning the peat moss outside. In a spirit of pure mischief the pig
                    would give a nip at the [del: ear] [supra: nose] of the dog the toe of the [del:
                    dog] [supra: boy] or at the ear of the lamb. The aggrieved subject gave a squeel
                    [sic] and the pig disappeared into space the three whose slumbering it had
                    disturbed following in hot haste the lamb contenting itself with looking at its
                    two companions castigating the offender. At other times the pig would come in
                    and lie down and sleep beside the three sleeping and share their potatoes and
                    was at home mostly then.’ [CW124 fos.50–2]</p>
                <p>The writer, meanwhile, ‘tired and fatigued … drew his cloak over him and
                    stretching himself on the wooden bench Gaelic, Seise, on which he sat, fell fast
                    asleep and slept soundly till the cold awoke him in the grey dawn of the
                    morning’ [CW172 fo.3]. This reminiscence is contradicted by the contemporary
                    evidence of the field notebook, which suggests that, after having recorded from
                    the MacDonalds, Carmichael walked about a mile or so to his friend Peggy
                    Robertson, Tobha Mòr, where he wrote down the texts of three fairy songs, before
                    travelling north again to the grieve Alexander MacDonald’s house at Driomor
                    where he spent the night.</p>
                <p>Although Alexander Carmichael returned to Duncan MacDonald’s house in
                    Snaoiseabhal for a second time on 28 March 1871 [CW119/19-21], he made no more
                    recording from his grandson Donald. After his grandparents’ deaths in the 1870s,
                    Donald continued to live in the household with his uncle Donald and aunt
                    Catherine: he appears as a labourer there in the 1881 census. It is known that
                    in October 1881 he married Ann MacEachan at Bornish. It is possible that he is
                    the 28-year old Donald MacDonald recorded in the 1891 census as an agricultural
                    labourer, a monoglot Gaelic speaker, on the glebe of the parish minister the
                    Rev. Roderick MacDonald at Dreumasdail. Donald MacDonald’s later life is yet to
                    be traced.</p>
