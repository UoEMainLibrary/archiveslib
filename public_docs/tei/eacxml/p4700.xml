            <biogHist>
                <p>Donald MacGillivary was born to William, army surgeon, and Effy née MacNeil on
                    Harris. By the age of 40 he was living in Eoligarry House on Barra with 10,000
                    acres of land according to the 1851 Census. At that time he had 10 servants
                    doing a variety of tasks, either working in the house or on the land. Of the six
                    visitors, two are of interest. Mary MacLellan, daughter of another tackman on
                    Harris, whose sister he would marry; and Bryce Campbell Young, an ornithologist
                    from Ardersier who was touring the islands. He was married on the 29 April 1851
                    after proclaiming his marriage on the 13, 20 and 27 April, to Christina
                    MacLellan of Milton, South Uist. The Reverend Henry Beatson, the Minister of
                    Barra conducted the ceremony. By 1861 he had two sons, William, now aged 8, and
                    Murdo, aged 7. According to the Census at this time the acreage was 5000, and he
                    employed 11 men and 46 women. Nine servants were employed in the house and a
                    cousin Isabella MacDonald, originally from Glasgow, was the Governess. Three
                    visitors were staying at the time, one a stonemason from Stornaway. It would
                    seem that most of the servants were from Uist, two from Harris and one from St.
                    Kilda. Carmichael met Dr MacGillivray on 16 March 1867 and went shooting with
                    him and Dr W.E. MacLellan, later dining at Eòlaigearraidh, Barra, in the
                    evening.</p>
                <p>MacGillivary and his family continued to run the farm with, in 1871, 18 servants,
                    one of whom was a cousin Jessie MacLellan. By 1881 the house had increased in
                    size with 16 rooms now having windows rather than 11 as recorded before. His
                    wife and sons were still living there together with a large number of servants. </p>
                <p>Donald died in February 1886 suffering from bronchitis. His son, Murdoch signed
                    the death certificate.</p>
                <p>Eoligarry house was built in 1795 by Colonel MacNeill in the style of Adam town
                    house. The house was demolished in 1976.</p>
