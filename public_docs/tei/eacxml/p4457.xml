            <biogHist>
                <p>John Ewen MacRury was born c. 1853 in South Uist, almost certainly in Torlum, to
                    Norman MacRury, farmer, and Catherine née MacPherson. The MacRury family gave a
                    great deal of material to Alexander Carmichael while he was staying on the
                    island, much of it from John Ewen MacRury himself; they continued to contribute
                    material after Alexander Carmichael had moved to Edinburgh. In Carmina Gadelica,
                    Carmichael described John Ewen MacRury as 'a highly intelligent man, for whose
                    knowledge of old lore I am greatly indebted in this work'. It is clear from the
                    Carmichael notebooks that between 1887 and 1895 he supplied Carmichael with a
                    significant amount of material he himself had collected in Uist and Benbecula
                    from the 1870s onwards, including almost an entire notebook of material. In
                    fact, evidence in the manuscripts suggests that he had a hand in composing many
                    of the entries making up the final part ('Notes etc.'') of the second volume. </p>
                <p>Following Carmichael's move to Edinburgh, it appears that John Ewen MacRury was a
                    regular visitor. His older brother John MacRury also supplied material to
                    Carmichael; he was educated at Glasgow University and in the 1861 census, is
                    listed as a schoolmaster and he later studied to become a minister in the Church
                    of Scotland, with John Ewen living with him as scholar. Although he is simply
                    listed as a 'farmer's son' in the 1881 census, by 1891 John Ewen MacRury was
                    working as a Railway Clerk in Greenock and in the 1901 census is listed as a
                    'navvy' in Larkhall, Mid-Lanark. </p>
                <p>He appears to have remained single throughout his life and died in a Poor House
                    in New Kirkland in the county of Lanark in January 1909.</p>
