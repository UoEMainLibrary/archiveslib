            <biogHist>
                <p>Alexander Carmichael, folklorist, antiquarian, and author, was born on 1 December
                    1832 in Taylochan, Lismore, ninth and youngest child of Hugh Carmichael
                    (1783-1862), farmer and publican, and Elizabeth (Betty) MacColl (1791-1863).
                    After attending schools on the island and, apparently, in Greenock, Carmichael
                    entered the civil service as an exciseman, serving in Greenock and Dublin before
                    stints in Islay and Carbost, Skye. There he joined the team of pioneering
                    folklorists collecting tales for the four-volume <span style="bibTitle">Popular
                        tales of the West Highland</span> (1860-1862) compiled under the auspices of
                    the tireless polymath John Francis Campbell (1821-1885). The principles of
                    'storyology' inculcated by Campbell - the necessity of recording the performance
                    accurately, accompanied by details concerning the informant - exerted a
                    fundamental influence upon his collecting for the rest of his life.
                    Nevertheless, such principles clashed with Carmichael's own artistic, spiritual,
                    and idealistic cast of mind, his desire to redeem Gaels and their traditions
                    from the odium of outsiders and the perceived hostility of the evangelical
                    church, and his belief that it was his duty not only to record the present, but
                    also to retrieve and reconstruct a glorious Gaelic past.</p>
                <p>Following a two-year interlude working in Cornwall, Carmichael returned north at
                    the end of 1864. This time, probably on his own request, he was assigned to the
                    Uists. His new post, initially based in Lochmaddy, allowed him to undertake
                    arduous journeys through some of the richest areas for folklore in western
                    Europe, scribbling down in a series of field notebooks an extraordinary range of
                    material ranging from long Fenian tales and ballads, through historical
                    narratives, songs, hymns, and charms, to anecdotes, observations, proverbs,
                    riddles, and unusual words. In addition, the influence and encouragement of the
                    surveyor and antiquarian Capt. F.W.L. Thomas focussed Carmichael's attention
                    upon archaeological sites in the Hebrides, and their associated traditions.
                    Although Carmichael had to rein back on his collecting expeditions following his
                    marriage to Mary Frances MacBean (1841-1928) in January 1868, and the births of
                    their four children Alexander (Alec) (1868-1941), Elizabeth (Ella) (1871-1928),
                    Eoghan (1878-1966), and Iain (1878-1928), the family's house at Creagorry, close
                    by the inn where people would wait until the South Ford between Benbecula and
                    South Uist could be crossed, meant that he could still gather much material from
                    passers-by.</p>
                <p>From 1873 Carmichael was able to experiment with presenting in print some of the
                    lore he had collected, through his position as Uist correspondent for the
                    Highlander, the radical crofting newspaper edited by John Murdoch (1818-1903),
                    whom he had first met when they worked together in Dublin some fifteen years
                    previously. He was increasingly preoccupied, however, with the idea of compiling
                    a series of volumes on the environment, history, and culture of the Outer
                    Hebrides, working up for the general public the vast store of material he had
                    gleaned throughout the islands. Such an ambitious project would require
                    considerably more leisure than he could afford in his exacting position.
                    Carmichael's attempt to secure Bhàlaigh farm in North Uist for this purpose met
                    with a rebuff from the estate; this, coupled with his increasing disillusion
                    regarding the somewhat philistine 'Uist gentry', as well as the need to ensure a
                    better education for his children, made him move to Oban. After a wearisome
                    couple of years there, spurning the Revenue's offer of a prestigious and
                    better-paid post in London, in 1880 Carmichael returned to Uist, taking a
                    substantial pay cut in the process. There, in Scolpaig, he finished writing an
                    appendix concerning Hebridean land customs for the third volume of <span
                        style="bibTitle">Celtic Scotland</span> (1876-1880), the magnum opus of the
                    Historiographer Royal William Forbes Skene (1809-92). In 1882 he once more left
                    Uist, this time for Edinburgh, where he was to spend the rest of his life.</p>
                <p>The liveliness of Carmichael's agrestic descriptions caught the eye of Francis,
                    Lord Napier (1819-98) - indeed, he later credited the piece with first inspiring
                    in him an interest in Highland affairs. Carmichael was requested by Napier to
                    contribute two similar appendices for the <span style="bibTitle">Report of the
                        Crofting Commission</span> (1884). Rather to his alarm, however, Carmichael
                    insisted on including a number of Gaelic songs and hymns in his work in order to
                    illustrate the grace and refinement of Hebridean crofters. Although Carmichael's
                    leanings towards spirituality were by no means latent previously, his interest
                    in the subject had doubtless been heightened both as a result of ongoing study
                    he was undertaking concerning the place-names of Iona, drawing upon his
                    comprehensive work on the toponymy of Uist and Barra for the Ordnance Survey,
                    and also the fact that, having lived among the islanders for many years, he was
                    now in a position to gather private and personal as well as more ostensibly
                    public lore. Carmichael's appendices in the Report proved exceptionally popular,
                    an uncontroversial oasis in an exceptionally contentious volume. This, and the
                    enthusiastic reception accorded a further paper on 'Uist old hymns' (1888),
                    encouraged Carmichael to embark upon a much larger work on the subject.</p>
                <p>During the final decade of the nineteenth century, Carmichael, now in retirement,
                    further consolidated his position not only as doyen of Edinburgh's Gaelic
                    intellectual community, but also as a crucial player in Scotland's Celtic
                    Renaissance, for instance in his contributions to the seminal journal <span
                        style="bibTitle">Evergreen</span> (1895-6) edited by Patrick Geddes
                    (1854-1932). These circles, in which scholarly interests interacted with
                    contemporary artistic movements, exerted a major influence on Alexander
                    Carmichael's greatest and most enduring work, the two volumes of <span
                        style="bibTitle">Carmina Gadelica</span> (1900). Encouraged and advised by
                    his protégé the scholar George Henderson (1866-1912), though with the rather
                    more sceptical counsel of fellow folklorists such as Father Allan MacDonald
                    (1859-1905), Carmichael compiled and edited a substantial collection of sacred
                    pieces, hymns, and charms, expressedly intended to illustrate the refined
                    spirituality, the crepuscular rhapsodic mysticism, the visionary qualities of
                    the people among whom he had lived for nearly two decades. With the help of the
                    publisher Walter Biggar Blaikie (1847-1928), and of his daughter Ella,
                    Carmichael was able to fashion a landmark in Scottish publishing, a stately,
                    sumptuously produced magnum opus, whose illustrations (by his wife) and
                    hand-made paper were surely intended to recall early Christian manuscripts, to
                    represent to the reader the original numinous experience of hearing the original
                    chants and lays.</p>
                <p>Despite the enthusiastic response of most reviewers to the Carmina Gadelica, and
                    notwithstanding that he was awarded an honorary LL.D. by the University of
                    Edinburgh in 1906, scholarly doubts soon surfaced concerning the editing
                    techniques employed. It is clear from Carmichael's manuscripts that he was
                    prepared to hone, polish, even rewrite substantial portions of his original
                    material before publishing, smoothing metre, cadence, and rhyme, heightening and
                    refining language, adding esoteric referents, even introducing obscure
                    vocabulary in order to enhance the impact which the hymns and charms - and
                    indeed the quotations from the informants themselves - would exert upon the
                    reader of the <span style="bibTitle">Carmina Gadelica</span>. Although
                    Carmichael continued to collect lore for the rest of his life - many of his new
                    informants were mainland contacts of his son-in-law the Gaelic scholar William
                    J. Watson (1865-1948) - it is noteworthy that he did not see the further volumes
                    he originally envisaged through the press. It was left to his daughter Ella to
                    bring out a new edition of the first two books of theCarmina in 1928, with a
                    third and fourth volume, edited by his grandson James Carmichael Watson
                    (1910-1942), appearing in 1940-1941.</p>
                <p> Although later scholars have cast some doubt on the editing practices he
                    employed in the creation of the <span style="bibTitle">Carmina Gadelica</span>,
                    Carmichael's great work, and his manuscript collection as a whole, remain an
                    indispensable treasure-trove, the fruits of a lifetime spent selflessly in the
                    service of his own people, gathering, preserving, communicating and interpreting
                    Gaelic culture, tradition, and lore for the wider world and for future
                    generations. Alexander Carmichael died in Edinburgh on 6 June 1912, and is
                    buried at St Moluag's on his native island of Lismore. Professor William John
                    Watson died in 1948. His son, James Carmichael Watson, born in 1910, and
                    successor to his father as Professor of Celtic at Edinburgh University in 1938,
                    contributed to later volumes of <span style="bibTitle">Carmina Gadelica</span> .
                    James Carmichael Watson died, missing in action, in 1942. </p>
