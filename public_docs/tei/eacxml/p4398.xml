            <biogHist>
                <p>Roderick MacLellan was born to Murdoch MacLellan and Marion née MacNeil. Sometime
                    before the 1841 Census, Murdoch MacLellan had moved his family to Milton, near
                    Kildonan, on South Uist. Roderick was the fifth of eight children, three
                    brothers and four sisters, the ages of which in 1841 were Christina (20), Jessie
                    (18), Mary (15), Donald (17), Roderick (12), Johana [Johannah] (8), Donald John
                    (6) and William Euan (4). </p>
                <p>By the time of the 1851 Census, Murdoch was running a large grazing farm of 3000
                    acres, and was employing 23 labourers, of which only 8 are noted in the Census,
                    plus several servants. His wife Marion is not recorded, and had presumably died;
                    and the children, Jessie, Mary, and Donald are also not recorded. Another son,
                    John Norman aged 9, was recorded giving a total number of six family members
                    residing with Murdoch. The three younger sons were at school, ages 18, 14 and 9.
                    The youngest servant was 14 and the oldest labourer was 27. Two visitors are
                    recorded at the time, both at school, and possibly friends of one of the
                    children. </p>
                <p>By the time of the 1861 Census, Murdoch had moved his family to Bàgh Thiarabhagh
                    Farm, which covered over 600 acres, in which he employed three labourers.
                    Roderick, by this time was the sole remaining family member in the house. This
                    farmhouse is recorded as having four windowed rooms. Sometime in 1869,
                    Carmichael met Roderick who narrated a story entitled 'Princes Charlies Pipe'
                    about a set of bagpipes which were believed to have been made for Prince Charles
                    Edward Stuart [Bonnie Prince Charlie]. The pipes were in the possession of
                    Roderick MacLellan when he recited the story.</p>
                <p>By 1871, Roderick was now the head of the farm, but had been married, as a
                    daughter, Mary Catherine, was living with him, aged 8. It is recorded that she
                    was born in South Uist. He and his daughter ran the farm with the help of a farm
                    labourer and two domestic servants. Recorded were also two boarders from Petty.
                    By the Census of 1881, Roderick and his daughter were still running the farm,
                    though it appears that the steading had been developed, as the numbers of rooms
                    with windows had increased from four to eight. </p>
                <p>Roderick died in March 1887 at Castlebay from unknown causes.</p>
