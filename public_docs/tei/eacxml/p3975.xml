            <biogHist>
                <p>Hector MacIsaac, wright, was born c1797 in the district of Iochdar, South Uist,
                    the son of Roderick and Ann née Macintyre. MacIsaac lived on the present-day
                    croft of 4 Ardmore, Iochdar, but probably travelled around the island as a
                    carpenter, the cottar smallholding he possessed in his native district being an
                    auxiliary to his main trade. Although Alexander Carmichael makes much of the
                    poverty and isolation Hector MacIsaac suffered in his old age when he knew him,
                    MacIsaac had travelled much in his younger days and had taught himself English.
                    Among the notes <span localType="mods-titleinfo">John Francis Campbell</span>
                    made when he visited the storyteller on 30 September 1871, he quotes (and
                    translates) a conversation between the two: <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Age
                        and poverty and all evils or [are] on my back my memory is gone but I have
                        travelled Scotland and I have never seen the man to beat me. I have learned
                        English. I was out selling eggs. I was a carpenter &amp;c. – give him a bit
                        backy. I gave him half a mutchkin 1/0 another two glasses in all 6 glasses
                        of whisky. </span><span localType="mods-titleinfo">[NLS Adv. MS 50.2.4
                        fo.226]</span> While engaged in collecting for <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">John Francis Campbell</span>’s <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">Popular Tales of the West Highlands</span>
                    project, <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Hector Maclean</span> certainly
                    visited MacIsaac in 1859, referring to him in his list of Uist and Barra
                    storytellers as: <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Hector MacIsaac, wright,
                        Iochdar, recited several legends for me and some tales about the Fînn. His
                        stories are principally dialogue.</span>
                    <span localType="mods-titleinfo">[NLS Adv. MS 50.1.7 fo.33]</span></p>
                <p>It is interesting to note, and rather puzzling too, that there are no stories
                    ascribed to MacIsaac in Campbell’s collections, either printed or in manuscript.
                    Alexander Carmichael, on the other hand, clearly enjoyed a particular rapport
                    with Hector MacIsaac. He recorded a <span localType="mods-titleinfo"
                        >Fenian</span> lay, <span localType="mods-titleinfo">‘Moladh Ghoill’</span>,
                    from the seanchaidh on 21 July 1865 <span localType="mods-titleinfo">[CW103
                        f.10v]</span>, and probably at least made notes on another poem, <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">‘Comhairle Fhinn air Oscar’</span>
                    <span localType="mods-titleinfo">[ibid. fo.10]</span>.On 6 October 1865
                    Carmichael returned to MacIsaac, recording from him two Fenian lays<span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">CW105/9</span>.</p>
                <p>The following year, on 24 April, Carmichael returned and recorded the story <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">‘Carmag mac Art mhic Cuinn
                        Cheud-chathaich’</span>, one of MacIsaac’s favourites. The notes he appended
                    to the tale offer us a precious insight into the character of the seanchaidh,
                    how he had acquired his stories, and indeed into the wider storytelling culture
                    in the islands at the time: <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Hector MacIosag
                        despises mythological tales and says they are great rubbish in which I fear
                        many men of greater pretention [sic] will concur. But of the Fingalians
                        tales he declares them to be worthy [of] the attention of princes – that
                        they are the most elegant excellent and delightful tales that man could
                        listen to. He says that he heard tales read as repeated by persons whom he
                        knows and that the tales were so garbled and mangled that he hung down his
                        head and closed his ears for very shame. He declares that When [he] is done
                        planting his potatoes he will travel over the F[ord]– a dis[tance] of about
                        21 m[iles] – to give me a proper opp[ortunity] of taking down any word he
                        has before he dies. He says he he [sic] neither son nor dau[ghter] except
                        one little girl to whom he can leave his legacy of prose and poetry. And as
                        he likes me better than any other person in the world he is desirous I
                        should become poss. of this invaluable legacy. Ind[eed?] he considers it an
                        imper[tinence] that his young daug[hter] does not exhibit a wish to become
                        poss[essor] of these tales of the Feine in prose and poetry. He dec[lares]
                        that there is no man from the Butt of Lewis to Barra Head – 200 m. – who has
                        the history of the Fing[alians] so well as he. Re[citers] are the most
                        egotistical set I have ever met. Each thinks himself much better than his
                        neigh. in reciting. Each declares that other re[citers] are only garbling
                        the tales. Ruarai Ruadh from whom E[achann] MacIosaig learnt his tales died
                        about 40 y[ears] ago – about 80 years of age. A gentleman came from
                        Edin[burgh] to take down from him. He remained several weeks from writing
                        from his dictation. For excelling so much in this Lord MacDon[ald]
                        generously gave him a house and piece of land free of rent and this he
                        enjoyed while he lived. Proba[bly] he was the last ?lsa? reciter who enjoyed
                        free lands for his an[cient] lore. He was a catechist and used to go about
                        catechising but in the reality his audiences were more partial to his old
                        lore than to better talk. And truth to say we believe the old man took more
                        delight in reciting and expounding the Fing[alian] tales and poems than
                        those of the Bible. </span><span localType="mods-titleinfo"

                <p>The high estimation in which Alexander Carmichael held Hector MacIsaac is
                    demonstrated by the fact that he was <span localType="mods-titleinfo">John
                        Francis Campbell</span>’s main informant on his Ossianic folklore tour,
                    arranged by Carmichael, in autumn 1871. Although Carmichael, at that time living
                    in Iochdar, accompanied <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Campbell</span> on at
                    least one visit to MacIsaac, this goes unmentioned in Campbell’s rough personal
                    journal of the occasion. In compiling and writing up the story of <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">‘Carmag mac Airt’</span> – the same tale which
                    had been recorded by Carmichael five years previouly – Campbell’s chief source

                        Ruadhri Ruagh a catechist who used to go about in the beginning of this
                        century reciting to audiences whom he first drew and then instructed in

                    Carmichael, then still living in the district, recorded antiquarian material
                    from Hector MacIsaac, Ceann Langabhat, Iochdar: information about the <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">MacMhuirichs</span> in Staoidhligearraidh, <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">Caisteal Bhuirgh</span>, <span

                        localType="mods-titleinfo">CW MS 119 fos.61v–?68v</span>]. On the same day,
                    though in a different notebook or on paper (we only have a transcription) he
                    recorded an outline of the legend of the <span localType="mods-titleinfo"
                        >Children of Lìr </span>who wer turned into swans for three hundred years
                        [<span localType="mods-titleinfo">CW 7 fos.17v–18</span>]. On the following
                    day, in another notebook, Carmichael took down from <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">MacIsaac</span> genealogical lore and a couple of
                    supernatural tales. These mostly relate to the remote east side of the island,
                    the MacIsaac kindred being notoriously immune to the attack of evil spirits
                    haunting <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Glen Liadail</span> there <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">CW90/41-52</span>.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most interesting item Carmichael recorded from Hector MacIsaac is, at
                    least in its manuscript version, the most problematic regarding its ascription
                    and dating. Carmichael had already collected a version of <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">Tòireachd na Táine</span> or <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">Táin Bó Cuailgne</span> from <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">Patrick Morrison</span>, Baile a’ Mhanaich,
                    Benbecula, over 17–18 April 1866 <span localType="mods-titleinfo">CW482; see
                        CW104/19; CW154/2</span>. On 15 August 1872 he recorded another telling of
                    the tale from Hector MacIsaac, but ascribed to the wrong reciter, and on the
                    wrong date as well.</p>
                <p>The reason why seems to be a stray stanza Carmichael had noted down from <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">Hector MacLeod</span>, the blind shoemaker from
                    Iochdar apparently related to MacIsaac, on 29 September 1871 <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">CW482 f.31</span>. Judging from the position of
                    the original verse, scribbled in pencil at the end of a neat transcription in
                    ink of Patrick Morrison’s version of the Tàin, what happened seems to have been
                    that Carmichael recited <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Morrison</span>’s <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">Tàin </span>to <span localType="mods-titleinfo"
                        >Hector MacLeod</span>, in the hope of gleaning some additions or
                    corrections to the tale. In the event, he received nothing more for his pains
                    than a few lines of obscure poetry which the reciter himself didn’t fully
                    understand.</p>
                <p>Carmichael later transcribed into a field notebook, in ink, the obscure verse he
                    had scribbled down from <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Hector MacLeod</span>
                    <span localType="mods-titleinfo">CW105/12</span>. It might be suspected that he
                    did so in order to recite it to the shoemaker’s relation Hector MacIsaac as a
                    prompt to see if he could throw any light on its meaning or provenance.
                    Doubtless he also told MacIsaac of the circumstances of the original recording.
                    The seanchaidh promptly went on to recite a full, and different, version of the
                        <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Tàin</span> itself.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, in the heading to the recording Carmichael misascribed the reciter
                    as <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Hector MacLeod</span>, the reciter of the
                    stanza who was by that time certainly dead, although he did preserve Hector
                    MacIsaac’s patronymic, Eachann mac Ruairidh <span localType="mods-titleinfo"
                        >CW105/14</span>. Not only did he get the name of the reciter wrong, but the
                    date too: 15 August 1873. We know that this is impossible because Carmichael’s
                    transcription of MacIsaac’s tale was read out to the <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">Gaelic Society of Inverness</span> in November
                    1872. What happened? It looks as if when Carmichael transcribed <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">Hector MacLeod</span>’s stanza into his field
                    notebook, he mistakenly dated the recording of the stray stanza to 1872. When he
                    headed the next item – MacIsaac’s <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Tàin</span> –
                    he realised that the stanza had in fact been jotted down the previous year. If
                    that year was 1872, then that meant that this year was 1873.</p>
                <p>The version of the Tàin as printed in the <span localType="mods-titleinfo"
                        >Transactions of the Gaelic Society of Inverness, ii</span>, is rightly
                    ascribed, to Eachann Mac-iosaig, Ceannlangabhat. Carmichael states that the
                    reciter: <span localType="mods-titleinfo">is a descendant of, and is called
                        after, Hector Macleod, the Uist bard … who rendered good service to many who
                        were out in the ’45.</span> [p. 39] This is indeed possible, but it may be
                    again that the writer confused the two Hectors, and that it was Hector MacLeod
                    the shoemaker who was a descendant of ‘the “mystery man” of eighteenth-century
                    Gaelic verse’ [<span localType="mods-titleinfo">Ronald Black, An Lasair
                        (Edinburgh: Birlinn, 2001), 461</span>]. Of course, both may have been
                    descendants – or, in MacIsaac’s case there may have been a connection through
                    fosterage. The family connection might explain their knowledge of the manuscript
                        <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Fear o’n Gharbh-thìr</span>, and their
                    shared interest in traditional tales.</p>
                <p>Hector MacIsaac is also mentioned in a marginal note written on 16 December 1874
                        <span localType="mods-titleinfo">CW380 f.90v</span>, the same day as the
                    birth of the Carmichaels’ third child <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Iain
                        Macdonald Carmichael</span>.</p>
                <p>Hector MacIsaac is one of the most vivid of Carmichael’s informants, his intense
                    and forceful personality making itself felt in all the recordings he made.
                    Carmichael pays the following, albeit not entirely dependable, tribute to the
                    storyteller in the introduction to <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Carmina
                        Gadelica</span>: <span localType="mods-titleinfo">The hut of Hector
                        Macisaac, Ceannlangavat, South Uist, stood in a peat-moss. The walls were of
                        ‘riasg’, turf, and the thatch of ‘cuilc’, reeds, to the grief of the
                        occupants, who looked upon the reed as banned, because it was used on
                        Calvary to convey the sponge with the vinegar. The hut was about fifteen
                        feet long, ten feet broad, and five feet high. There was nothing in it that
                        the vilest thief in the lowest slum would condescend to steal. It were
                        strange if the inmates of this turf hut in the peat-morass had been other
                        than ailing. Hector Macisaac and his wife were the only occupants, their
                        daughter being at service trying to prolong existence in her parents. Both
                        had been highly endowed physically, and were still endowed mentally, though
                        now advanced in years. The wife knew many secular runes, sacred hymns, and
                        fairy songs; while the husband had numerous heroic tales, poems, and
                        ballads.I had visited these people before, and in September 1871, Iain F.
                        Campbell of Islay and I went to see them. Hector Macisaac, the unlettered
                        cottar who knew no language but his own, who came into contact with no one
                        but those of his own class, his neighbours of the peat-bog, and who had
                        never been out of his native island, was as polite and well-mannered and
                        courteous as Iain Campbell, the learned barrister, the world-wide traveller,
                        and the honoured guest of every court in Europe. Both were at ease and at
                        home with one another, there being neither servility on the one side nor
                        condescension on the other. The stories and poems which Hector Macisaac went
                        over during our visits to him would have filled several volumes. Mr.
                        Campbell now and then put a leading question which brought out the
                        story-teller’s marvellous memory and extensive knowledge of folklore.</span>

                <p>Hector MacIsaac died of old age on 11 July 1878, at his home in Ardmore, Iochdar,
                    South Uist. Hector MacIsaac’s wife, <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Ann
