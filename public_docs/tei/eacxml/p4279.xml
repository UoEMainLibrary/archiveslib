            <biogHist>
                <p>Christina or Chirsty MacInnes was born in 1806, daughter of Dugald MacInnes,
                    crofter, and Effy or Oighrig née MacInnes. By 1841 she was living as a cottar
                    with her widowed mother and her sister Mary (1818–95) at 9 Hacleit. In 1852 Mary
                    had a natural son Dugald by William MacAulay: he took over the croft after the
                    previous tenants moved to Lìonacleit in 1879.</p>
                <p>Alexander Carmichael recorded Cairistìona nighean Dùghaill on 16 June 1876,
                    possibly at his own house in Creag Goraidh. He describes her as ‘bean bhoc[hd] a
                    bhios a sniomh dhan mhnaoi agam’ (‘a poor woman who spins for my wife’): in
                    other words, one of the women who was involved in Mary Frances’ ‘Home
                    Industries’ charity work. She sang for him what appears to be a song by a
                    betrayed lover, then stray lines from the beginning of the Fenian ballad about
                    Conall [Gulban], and a recommendation to consult ‘Donul Curri S[outh]
                    Lochboisdale’ [CW150/84-85]. Chirsty MacInnes may also have recited the items
                    which follow: two apparently related prayers, <span>Ùrnaigh Togail an
                        Teine</span>, and <span>A Dhé fadaidh féin ’nam chridhe a-steach</span>, the
                    saying <span>‘Bu mhath an t-saighdearachd mur bhi na blàir’</span>, and the word
                        <span>Aithealag</span>, <span>éibhleag</span>, translated as ‘small peat
                    fire’ [CW150/86-91].</p>
                <p>From the purple and black pencils used in this recording session, it’s clear that
                    Carmichael thereupon opened another notebook and continued taking down items
                    from Chirsty MacInnes: the well-known and lengthy religious hymn <span>Laoidh
                        Dhùghaill Liosadair</span> [CW119/57], a version of the prayer before sleep
                        <span>Laighidh mi a-nochd</span> [CW119/58], as well as, perhaps, some
                    remarks on the story behind the song <span>Laoidh na h-Ighne</span> which
                    Carmichael had taken down from Duncan MacDonald, Snaoiseabhal, some five years
                    previously (probably after she herself had sung it), and the phrase <span>Bheir
                        bumailear breith ach có bheir ceart[as?]</span> [CW119/60].</p>
                <p>Christina MacInnes died on 17 February 1894 of ‘asthma [and] old age’. Her death
                    certificate was witnessed by her nephew Dugald MacInnes or MacAulay.</p>
                <p>Alexander Carmichael ascribes to Christina MacInnes <span>Coisrig Cadail</span>,
                    a <span>Sleep Consecration</span> [<span localType="mods-titleinfo">CG</span> i,
                    80–1] which has a few points of contact with her own prayer before sleep;
                    another sleep prayer <span>Laighim am Leabaidh</span> [ibid., 94–5]; and a
                    description of how to set the <span>iomairt</span> (cloth striped lengthwise):
                        <span>Suidheachadh na h-Iomairt</span> [ibid., 302–3].</p>
                <p>From notes made concerning the projected content of the volume which would become
                        <span>Carmina Gadelica</span>, Alexander Carmichael certainly considered
                    ascribing to her <span>Ora Turais</span> (‘Ionnlai mi m aodan’) and the cattle
                    charm ‘Siubhal coire siubhal coille’ [CW124 fo.3]; also<span> Laoidh Dhughaill
                        Liosadair</span>, the prayer before sleep <span>Laighidh mise
                    a-nochd</span>, as well as <span>Laoidh na h-Ighne</span>, this last under the
                    title <span>Binneach nam Beann</span> [ibid. fos.6, 8]; and finally the charm
                        <span>Achlasan Chaluim Chille</span> [ibid. fo.9]. If these ascriptions are
                    correct, she well merited his tribute to her in a footnote to his list of
                    reciters: ‘She had an immense amount of old lore, runes, and stories of great
                    literary interest’ [<span localType="mods-titleinfo">CG</span> ii, 375].</p>
                <p>Although no items ascribed to Christina’s sister Mary appear in extant field
                    notebooks, Carmichael clearly recorded from her. Her name is given as the
                    informant for <span>Ora Buadh</span> [‘Cumraig Dhe is Dhomhnach’] in the draft
                        <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Carmina</span> contents [CW124 fo.3], while
                    in the printed volumes she is cited as the source for <span>An Liuthail</span>
                        (<span>‘The Lustration’</span>) [<span localType="mods-titleinfo">CG</span>
                    i, 58–9], as well as information about the <span>loireag</span> (‘a small mite
                    of womanhood that does not belong to this world, but to the world thither’) on
                    Beinn Mhór [ibid. ii, 320–1].</p>
                <p>Again, in the drafts Christina’s nephew Dugald MacAulay (1852–1910) is given as
                    the source for two charms: <span>a Sian</span> (‘An sian chuir Moir air a Mac’)
                    and a version of the well-known bone-healing charm beginning <span>Chaidh Brìde
                        a-mach</span> [CW124 fo.9]. These are both ascribed to him in <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">Carmina Gadelica</span> [<span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">CG</span> ii, 18–19, 36–7], with the additional
                    footnote: ‘He very kindly showed me the rites for curing the sprain and the red
                    pleura and for counteracting the evil eye’ [ibid. 379n.6].</p>
                <p>On 4 September 1906 Alexander Carmichael would record from Dugald MacAulay the
                    song <span>Cuist Eònachain</span> [CW244 fos.139–40].</p>
                <p>Dugald MacAulay, who ‘has a reputation in the island as a good storyteller’
                    [Angus Macmillan and Taigh Eachdraidh Bheinn na Faghla, <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">Benbecula Donors in Carmina Gadelica</span>
                    (Balivanich, 2007), 21], is given as the source for a number of other items
                    printed in later volumes of <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Carmina
                        Gadelica</span>: <span>Altachadh</span>, or <span>Altachadh
                        Shomhairle</span>; <span>Guidhe Turais</span> (‘He learned it from his
                    mother and from her sister, who lived with his mother. These two old women had
                    innumerable hymns, songs, stories and fables, sayings and proverbs, full of
                    wisdom and beauty, almost all of which died with them.’); <span>Am Beannachadh
                        Turais</span> (‘The reciter … said that he always recited this little prayer
                    to himself, ‘fo m’anail’, ‘under my breath’, when he went upon a journey,
                    however short the distance, however small the matter of his errand’),
                        <span>Beannachadh Taimh</span>; <span>Eòlas Faireimidh</span> (<span>‘Charm
                        for the Evil Eye’</span>); and <span>Teab an t-Sionnaich</span> [ibid. iii,
                    54–5, 178–9, 180–1, 338–9; iv, 170–1, 248].</p>
                <p>To the first of these is appended the description: ‘MacAulay is an old man, full
                    of old songs and hymns, runes and incantations, fairy stories and strange
                    beliefs. These he heard from his aunt and mother, who were full of song and
                    story, natural and supernatural, and of old lore of the most curious kind. … He
                    said that Somhairle Mac Calmain was a good man, moving about doing no harm,
                    asking nothing and always getting enough. In his travels he was always crooning
                    these little hymns to himself. This description might fit MacAulay himself, save
                    that he seldom leaves his wind-swept moorland home.’ </p>
