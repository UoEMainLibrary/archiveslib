            <biogHist>
                <p>Mary MacMillan was the daughter of John MacMillan (born c. 1785), soldier and
                    crofter, from Benbecula, and Christina née Ferguson (born c. 1796), from North
                    Uist. In 1841 the family are recorded in Buaile Dhubh, an t-Ìochdar: as well as
                    Mary, there are also Peggy (born c. 1821), followed by Kenneth (born c. 1825),
                    Ranald (born c. 1827), John (born c. 1832), Flora (born c. 1835), and Kitty
                    (born c. 1837). An elder brother Donald (born c. 1821), possibly a twin of
                    Peggy, was not living in the household at the time. Ten years later, with John
                    MacMillan described as a Chelsea Pensioner, the family is living in Lionacuith,
                    near the farm and church of Father James MacGregor at Ardkenneth. In the 1861
                    census the widowed Christina is recorded as head of the family, and the eldest
                    brother Donald, now working as a joiner, has returned to the household.</p>
                <p>Alexander Carmichael first recorded Mary MacMillan in April 1869, during several
                    months of intensive song collecting. And again in May, after a day recording
                    from songs Penelope MacMillan (c. 1795–1873), Bean Ormacleit, returned to Mary. </p>
                <p>Dating from 1872 are two items ascribed to Mary MacMillan, a prayer,
                        <span>Guidhe</span> (‘Gach latha subhach dhuit’), and a charm <span>Eòlas
                        Leigheis</span> (‘Dèanam-sa duit/Eòlas air greigh…’) [<span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">CG</span> iii, 234–5; iv, 304–5; cf. CW494
                    fos.371–3]. She is also given as the source in <span localType="mods-titleinfo"
                        >Carmina Gadelica</span> for what appears to be a waulking song, <span>Sgian
                        air chall</span> [<span localType="mods-titleinfo">CG</span> v, 42–3].
                    Judging from the 1871 census, by that time the unmarried Mary was living alone
                    with her mother Christina, although her brother Kenneth was living next door
                    with his family. Mary MacMillan died in February 1883 of consumption. Her
                    brother-in-law Donald MacLean was present at her death. </p>
