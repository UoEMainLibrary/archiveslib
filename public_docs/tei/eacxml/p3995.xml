            <biogHist>
                <p>John MacInnes, Iain mac Phàdraig, was the son of Peter MacInnes, crofter, and
                    Marion née MacLeod. Born c. 1805, by 1841 MacInnes was living in
                    Staoidhligearraidh, South Uist, married to Marion (c. 1803– ). They had at least
                    four children: Ann (b. 1835), Donald (b. 1836), Catherine or Kitty (b. 1839),
                    and John (b. 1843). In 1871 the two youngest children were still living in the
                    household, as well as an eighteen-year old farm servant Euphemia MacEachen, and
                    two young grandchildren, Angus and Donald Campbell.</p>
                <p>Alexander Carmichael visited John MacInnes ‘in his own house’ at
                    Staoidhlegearraidh on 29 January 1875. Earlier on that day he had recorded a
                    waulking song <span>’S e siud an leannan ainmeil</span> from his daughter Ann,
                    now married to Angus Campbell [CW MS 106 fos.4v-3v]. She evidently suggested to
                    Carmichael that he visit her father, in whose household two of her children were
                    then being brought up. An intensive and lengthy recording session ensued.</p>
                <p>MacInnes began with a narrative about MacMhuirich Mór (‘the first who came to
                    Staolig[earry] of the race’) and a fairy changeling [CW106/121], following on
                    with a supernatural tale [CW106/122]; the local legend of MacMhuirich and the
                    Mhuileartaich [CW106/123]; information concerning Dùn Raghnaill and Raghnall mac
                    Ailein of Clan Ranald [CW106/124]; another supernatural tale, concerning seals
                    [CW106/125]; the superhumanly aged Cailleach Ghlinn Dorcha [CW106/126]; and the
                    extended Fenian tale <span>Ceudach nan Collachain Òir</span> [CW106/127]. This
                    last he had heard from Donald MacPhee, Domhnall mac Aonghais ’ic Phroinsiais at
                    Càrnan, Ìochdar, who had died some five or six years previously. The evidently
                    inexhaustible MacInnes went on to narrate the story of MacMhuirich’s prayer
                    [CW106/128], as well as giving a brief overview of the mythical origin of the
                    family in Ireland, their discovery of the Red Book, and the land they possessed
                    in South Uist CW106/128]. Finally, Carmichael recorded a fascinating extended
                    list of titles of stories, ballads, and songs: what appears to be an inventory
                    of John MacInnes’ complete repertoire [CW106/129].</p>
                <p>Carmichael visited John MacInnes again on 30 March 1877, when he recorded a
                    couple of protective charms for cattle: <span>Rann Àirigh</span> and <span>Rann
                        Spréidh</span>, as well as <span>Laoidh na h-Ighne</span>, ‘Fhuair mo
                    leannan am chadal’ [CW108/37, CW108/38, CW108/39, CW108/82, CW108/83]. This last
                    had already been recorded from Duncan MacDonald, Donnchadh an Tàilleir,
                    Snaoiseabhal, on 28 March 1871 [CW119/19].</p>
                <p>According to the 1881 census, the now widowed John was being supported by his now
                    married son John and his wife Catherine, who had just had a baby Marion, as well
                    as his unmarried daughter Catherine. Another two grandchildren, Marion and
                    Donald J Campbell, also shared what must have been a rather cramped household.
                    In 1891 almost the same people lived there, although Marion Campbell had left,
                    while Marion MacInnes now had a younger sister, six year old Mary.</p>
                <p>On 16 September 1890 John MacInnes was visited again at his home in
                    Staoidhlegearraidh, this time apparently by John Ewen MacRury [1853–1909] who
                    was collecting material on behalf of Carmichael. Given that Carmichael was then
                    planning a collection of charms and blessings which would eventually blossom
                    into the first two volumes of <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Carmina
                        Gadelica</span>, it is interesting that three of the items MacRury recorded
                    were identical to those written down by Carmichael from MacInnes in 1877:
                        <span>Laoidh na h-Ighne</span>, <span>Beannachadh Spréidhe</span> (i.e.
                        <span>Rann Àirigh</span>), and a brief allusion to the <span>Òrtha na
                        Buachailleachd</span> which Carmichael had recorded that same year from Mary
                    Stewart, Malacleit, Màiri Bhreac [CW108/10]. Also taken down were a version of
                    the <span>Altachadh Leapa</span>, a story about the haunted Gleann Liadail,
                    reminiscences about Prince Charles in South Uist, and what might be a charm
                    against evil eye [CW1/11-18]. Both <span>Laoidh na h-Ighne</span>, <span>Rann
                        Àirigh</span>, and <span>Rann Spréidh</span> appear as ascribed to MacInnes
                    in the draft contents to the work which would become <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">Carmina Gadelica</span> [CW124 f.2]. The title of
                    the religious hymn <span>Duan an Domhnaich</span> is also under his name [CW124
                    fo.8].</p>
                <p>First recorded by Carmichael a decade after he first arrived in the Outer Isles,
                    John MacInnes was something of a late, and serendipitous, discovery for the
                    folklorist. He had apparently eluded Hector Maclean and John Francis Campbell
                    during their expeditions to Uist while compiling <span>Popular Tales of the West
                        Highlands</span>; his name is tellingly absent from the field notes compiled
                    by Campbell during his trip to the islands in 1871. Evidently a highly gifted
                        <span>seanchaidh</span> with a wide-ranging repertoire, the example of John
                    MacInnes suggests to us that there must have been a number of other equally
                    capable ‘tradition bearers’ in the islands who, for whatever reason, never
                    caught the attention of collectors. One wonders if the grandchildren who lived
                    with John MacInnes absorbed at least some of their grandfather’s store.</p>
                <p>In <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Carmina Gadelica</span> Alexander Carmichael
                    ascribes three items to ‘John Macinnes, Crofter, Staoligearry’. One
                        [<span>CG</span> i, 82–3] is an ornate <span>Beannachadh Leapa</span> which
                    exhibits occasional points of similarity with the <span>Altachadh Leapa</span>
                    written down by MacRury. The two other items are a heavily polished version of
                    MacInnes’ <span>Rann Àirigh</span> [<span>CG</span> ii, 130–1], and an extended
                    riff by Carmichael and his assistants on <span>Féith Mhoire</span>, using as its
                    starting-off point the ‘casa curra’ phrase appearing in Màiri Bhreac’s
                        <span>Òrtha na Buachailleachd</span> and alluded to by MacInnes in his
                    recording session with John Ewen MacRury in 1890 [<span>CG</span> ii, 132–5]. In
                    a footnote to the list of reciters, Carmichael pays his own tribute: ‘Several
                    volumes of old lore, mostly heroic tales, died with this nice, intelligent man’
                        [<span>CG</span> ii, 375]. John MacInnes died of ‘senile decay’ in March
                    1894. His grandson Angus Campbell was present.</p>
