            <biogHist>
                <p>William Sinclair was born at Arisaig illegitimately to Mary MacIsaac who was a
                    domestic servant. He met and married Mary MacEachin also from Arisaig. By the
                    1841 Census he was working as a publican in Àiridh nam Bàn on South Uist with
                    Mary and daughter Catherine (12). Three staff were working for him and lodged
                    separately from the main house, Moira Sinclair (65) who was a domestic nurse,
                    Donald MacDonald (25) and Margaret MacIntyre (20) both working as servants. Ten
                    years later William had moved to Bàgh Thiarabhagh on Barra with Mary and had
                    opened an inn. He employed two servants, Catherine Gilles (19) from Arisaig, and
                    Alexander MacDonald (27) from South Uist. His occupation was still innkeeper in
                    1861, the inn being recorded as having four rooms each with windows. His staff
                    had increased but also changed: Peter MacDonald (22) from Uist; Flora MacKinnon
                    (30) from Barra; and Catherine MacDonald (30) from Arisaig. Living with them was
                    his niece Mary MacEachin (8), and a General Practitioner Alexander R. MacDonald
                    originally from South Uist, and gained his medical degree at University of
                    Glasgow. Business must have been profitable for William as he had increased the
                    number of rooms with windows to seven, and had given his staff specific titles:
                    Ann MacRae (20) was the housemaid, from North Uist; Catherine Morrison (29) was
                    the kitchen maid from South Uist; and Donald MacKinnon was a general servant
                    from Barra.</p>
                <p>William died in April 1874 suffering from senile degeneration, nephritis and
                    pulmonary congestion, being survived by his wife who signed the death
                    certificate.</p>
                <p>Carmichael met William and recorded the four stanzas from the Fenian ballad
                    'Garabh agus na Mnathan' and a second song.</p>
