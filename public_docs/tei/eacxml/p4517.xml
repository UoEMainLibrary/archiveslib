            <biogHist>
                <p>Ann MacPhee was the daughter of Angus MacPhee (born c. 1821) son of Donald,
                    crofter, Càrnan, an t-Ìochdar, South Uist, and Margaret or Peggy, née Maclellan
                    (born c. 1816). She was born on 25 March 1847, and baptised four days later. Her
                    sponsor was Donald MacDonald, Domhnall mac Iain ’ic Ailein in Càrnan, and the
                    baptism was carried out by Allan Maclean, Sagart Beag na Spàinne.</p>
                <p>It appears that Ann MacPhee is recorded in the 1861 census while visiting or
                    lodging with her uncle, the blacksmith Donald MacPhee, and his household in
                    Staoinebrig. Ten years later she is back in her parent’s household in
                    Càrnan.</p>
                <p>In February 1873 Ann MacPhee married Archibald Mackinnon (born c. 1841) , son of
                    John and Harriet née MacPhee. By the time of the 1891 census they had had at
                    least nine children: John (b. 1875) Margaret (b. 1876), Mary (b. 1877), Angus
                    (b. 1878), Euphemia, Effie or Oighrig (b. 1880), Maggie (b. 1883), Christina or
                    Tina (b. 1885), Lachlan (b. 1886), and Johnanna (b. 1889). At the time of the
                    1901 census grandson Archy Mackinnon (b. 1900) was living in the household too.
                    Although recorded as a cottar in the 1881 and 1891 censuses, Archibald Mackinnon
                    was working as a mason by 1901. The couple spoke only Gaelic, though at least
                    some of their children were bilingual.</p>
                <p>Ann Mackinnon née MacPhee died of ‘phthisis pulmonalis’ or tuberculosis, from
                    which she had suffered for two years, in February 1905. Her husband signed the
                    death certificate.</p>
                <p>Carmichael ascribes the charm Achlasan Chaluim-Chille to ‘Ann Macphie, crofter’s
                    daughter, Carnan’ [CG ii, 98–9, 379]. Because of the absence of an original
                    field text, this is not impossible, but it should be noted that this charm is
                    rather more credibly ascribed to Flora MacLeod, ‘Fionnghal nighean Tormoid’,
                    from the same village, in the draft title lists used in compiling what was to
                    become Carmina Gadelica. It is interesting to note, however, that in these lists
                    a version of the smooring charm Smàladh an Teine is ascribed to ‘Ann Macphie
                    Crofter Staonabrig’: if the same Ann, is this evidence for an early text of a
                    common charm recorded while she was still staying in Staoinibrig?</p>
