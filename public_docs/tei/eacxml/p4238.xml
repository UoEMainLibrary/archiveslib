            <biogHist>
                <p>Duncan MacDonald, Donnchadh mac an Tàilleir, was the son of John MacDonald (c.
                    1760–c. 1830), farmer and tailor, son of Norman descended according to family
                    tradition from MacRurys of North Uist, and Mary MacDonald, daughter of Donald
                    MacDonald. MacDonald is recorded in the censuses, perhaps rather too positively,
                    as a farmer living at Snaoiseabhal, South Uist. According to family tradition,
                    he had previously rented Geirinis before moving there c. 1844, where he occupied
                    ‘half a croft’. In addition to working the land, he was a stonemason.</p>
                <p>Duncan MacDonald was said by his grandson, the <span>seanchaidh</span> Donnchadh
                    Clachair, to have been married twice, his first wife being ‘nighean
                    Mhaol-Dòmhnaich’ from Benbecula. From this marriage he had two daughters.
                    Duncan’s second wife was Mary Macintyre (c. 1794–1878), daughter of Donald
                    Macintyre, Domhnall Ruadh, from Baile Buidhe. According to Donnchadh Clachair,
                    the couple married c. 1822; they had three sons, an older John who does not
                    appear in the census records and who died aged 21 from overwork, having had to
                    labour both on his father’s tack at Geirinis and for the landlord Colonel John
                    Gordon of Cluny, another younger John (born c. 1829), and Donald (c. 1836–1919);
                    and two daughters both named Catherine: Donald’s mother (1831–75) and another
                    daughter who would live with her parents (born c. 1842). In 1851 the family are
                    recorded as having Duncan’s elder sister Catherine (born c. 1771) staying with
                    them.</p>
                <p>Alexander Carmichael met Duncan MacDonald at his house in Snaoiseabhal in 1869,
                    during one of several journeys he carried out during the first half of that year
                    intensively collecting songs. He describes Duncan as ‘a smart little man
                    sor[e]ly afflicted with rheumatism. Has a clear blue eye &amp; an intelligent
                    face’ [CW107/42]. Duncan MacDonald recited the Fenian ballad <span>Seathan mac
                        Rìgh Builbh</span>, or <span>Beirghe</span>, also known as ‘Long an ògain’
                    [CW107/40], before giving Carmichael another of the same genre, <span>Laoidh
                        Dhiarmaid</span> [CW107/42]. Both these items he had originally heard from
                    his father.</p>
                <p>The following day Carmichael resumed recording, now from Duncan’s eldest
                    grandson, ‘this wonderful child of song modesty and memory’ [CW172] as he was to
                    remember him perhaps twenty years later. This child was the six-year old Donald
                    MacDonald (b. 1862), son of Catherine and her husband Alexander MacDonald
                    (1832–1872), son of Donald, ‘Domhnall mac Dhomhnaill ’ic Iain ’ic Dhomhnaill ’ic
                    Iain ’ic Iain ’ic Raghnaill Bhòrnais’. ‘The boy's grandfather Donl mac an
                    taillear, Donald son [of] the tailor – a nice old man sat in a corner enveloped
                    in friendly peat smoke and now and again scolded the boy in a friendly way for
                    not attending to the gentleman’ [CW172 fos.1v–2]. Donald was either staying in
                    his grandfather’s household at the time, or had been sent there that day in
                    order to recite for the folklorist.</p>
                <p>Carmichael also recorded a Fenian narrative from Duncan (misnamed as Donald)
                        <span>Bruighin Chaorainn</span> [CW172 fos.44–5], again heard from his
                    father, then wrote down from his grandson a long version of the Fenian ballad
                        <span>Laoidh na Muileartaich</span> [CW172 fos.45v–50] learnt from Duncan,
                    who again had heard it from his father. The boy’s father Alexander may have been
                    present (possibly suggesting that the boy had been taken there to perform for
                    Carmichael) and given the next item, his own extended patronymic and his
                    relation to Marshal MacDonald, the Duke of Tarentum.</p>
                <p>Donald then sang a lament, again learnt from his grandfather, ‘do Thormaid Mac
                    Mhic ic Ailein’ [ CW172 fos.50v–52v], for a Norman son of MacDonald of Clan
                    Ranald who had died of yellow fever while studying in France – possibly the
                    mysterious son of Ranald (1692–1766) recorded in Clan Donald iii as having
                    studied law in Glasgow, although ‘[n]othing further is known of him’ [A. &amp;
                    A. MacDonald, <span localType="mods-titleinfo">The Clan Donald</span> (3 vols,
                    Inverness, 1896–1904), 235].</p>
                <p>Carmichael later wrote that, after recording several other items from his
                    grandson, ‘tired and fatigued … drew his cloak over him and stretching himself
                    on the wooden bench Gaelic, Seise, on which he sat, fell fast asleep and slept
                    soundly till the cold awoke him in the grey dawn of the morning’ [CW172 fo.3].
                    This reminiscence is contradicted by the contemporary evidence of the field
                    notebook, which suggests that, after having recorded from the MacDonalds,
                    Carmichael walked about a mile or so to his friend Peggy Robertson, Tobha Mòr,
                    where he wrote down the texts of three fairy songs, before travelling north
                    again to the grieve Alexander MacDonald’s house at Driomor where he spent the
                    night. It should also be noted that the 1871 census records Duncan’s son Donald,
                    a mason, and the unmarried Catherine as being members of the household.</p>
                <p>Alexander Carmichael returned to Duncan MacDonald’s house in Snaoiseabhal for a
                    second time on 28 March 1871. He recorded from the old man the love song Dhùisg
                    mo leannan mi ’m chadal, better known as <span>Laoidh na h-Ighne</span>,
                    ‘composed by an insane girl who became insane about a young man with whom she
                    was in love’ [CW119/19], as well as a version of the well-known legend
                        <span>Àirigh na h-Aon Oidhche</span> [CW119/20].</p>
                <p>Duncan MacDonald died of ‘old age and debility’ at 10am on 29 October 1873. His
                    son Donald was present. This Donald was the father of the celebrated
                        <span>seanchaidh</span> Duncan MacDonald (1882–1954), Donnchadh mac
                    Dhomhnaill ’ic Dhonnchaidh, Donnchadh Clachair, himself the father of the bard
                    and folklorist Donald John MacDonald (1919–86). </p>
