            <biogHist>
                <p>Peter or Patrick Smith, crofter, was born in South Uist around 1796; his full
                    patronymic was Pàdra mac Aonghais ’ic Dhòmhnaill ’ic Phàdraig <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">CW7/4</span>. Patrick Smith's parents were Angus
                    Smith, crofter, and Christina née Currie, descended from the learned <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">MacMhuirich bardic family</span>. It’s likely
                    that much of Patrick’s rich store of tales was derived from his mother’s side of
                    the family.</p>
                <p>Patrick Smith married Marion Campbell (born c. 1796). Between 1829 and 1845 they
                    are recorded as having had nine children. Marion had presumably died by the 1851
                    census, when Patrick is recorded as living with six of their children, John,
                    Christina or Christy, Angus, Mary, and Marion.</p>
                <p>By the time the Islay schoolteacher <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Hector
                        Maclean</span> arrived in South Uist on his first collecting expedition on
                    behalf of <span localType="mods-titleinfo">John Francis Campbell </span>at the
                    end of July 1859, Patrick Smith, living on a four-acre croft in Leth Meadhanach,
                    was known as one of the finest storytellers in the island: his name heads the
                    list of men and women with lore which Maclean sent Campbell the following
                    February: ‘a Catholic: neither reads nor writes’ <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">[NLS Adv. MS 50.1.7 fo. 33]</span>. Maclean
                    recorded from him at least three stories, <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Mac
                        a’ Bhreabadair</span>, <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Mac an
                        t-Seòladair</span> and <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Am Marsanta a Chuir
                        an t-Sùil à Mac an Duine Eile</span>
                    <span localType="mods-titleinfo">[NLS Adv. MS 50.1.10 fos.270–5, 415–22, 423–38;
                        PTWH iv, 438, 440; MWHT i, 394–409; ii, 120–50]</span>. On 3 September 1859,
                    John Francis Campbell himself visited Smith [PTWH i, xxx, xxxiii, 156]. He was
                    rather astonished by the story he was told: Am Marsanta…, the same tale Patrick
                    Smith had recited to Maclean a few weeks earlier. This illiterate crofter from
                    the Outer Hebrides had just recited for him a story which was clearly related to
                    one in the Arabian Nights<span localType="mods-titleinfo"> [NLS Adv. MSS
                        50.1.13, fos.415–16; 50.1.14 fos.265v, 331–2, 357; PTWH iv, 430, at least
                        nos.337-341]</span>! On 17 September 1860 Hector Maclean once more visited
                    Patrick Smith, recording from him the Fenian story <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">A’ Mhuileartach</span>
                    <span localType="mods-titleinfo">[NLS Adv. MSS 50.2.1 fo.224;
                        50.7.6(xix)]</span>, the Fenian lay <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Laoidh
                        Oscair</span>
                    <span localType="mods-titleinfo">[PTWH iii, 328, 329; iv, 450]</span>, and
                    probably also the tale <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Macabh Mòr mac Rìgh na
                        Sorcha</span>
                    <span localType="mods-titleinfo">[NLS Adv. MS 50.1.12 fo.65; PTWH iii, 400,
                        450]</span>.</p>
                <p>Later in life, Carmichael wrote of Patrick Smith that, along with Campbell and
                    Maclean, he <span localType="mods-titleinfo">‘took down many pieces of prose and
                        of poetry from him’</span>
                    <span localType="mods-titleinfo">[CG iii, 230]</span>. It’s rather striking,
                    however, that the gauger doesn’t appear to have visited Smith until he had been
                    more than four years in Uist. Perhaps he thought that Maclean had recorded the
                    seanchaidh’s best stories already; more likely, Patrick Smith’s house in Leth
                    Meadhanach, towards the southern end of South Uist, was somewhat out of the way
                    for the exciseman as he travelled up and down the Long Island.</p>
                <p>As far as we can see from his notebooks, Carmichael first visited Smith on 24
                    April 1869, when he was collecting Fenian ballads for the Rev. Archibald Clerk’s
                    new edition of Macpherson’s ‘Ossianic’ epics. That day Smith recited for his
                    visitor <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Laoidh na h-Inghinne</span> and <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">Laoidh Oscair</span>. He had heard the first lay:
                        <span localType="mods-titleinfo">'42 years ago [1827] from Rua'raidh mor
                        Mac-a-Phiocair from Airi-mhic-rury North Uist. Mac-a-Phiocair lived at Leth
                        mheadhonach for a year then for two years at Baoghastal whence he went to
                        Cape Breton. He had much old lore.'</span> Either narrator or transcriber
                    must have made a mistake here: the most likely candidate is the bard, piper, and
                    fiddler <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Niall Ruadh Mór MacVicar</span>
                    (c1779–c1861), who arrived in <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Cape
                        Breton</span> in October 1829. The second lay, which Smith had already
                    recited for Hector Maclean nine years previously, he ascribed – possibly in
                    error again – to a fellow villager <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Niall Ruadh
                        MacDonald</span>, <span localType="mods-titleinfo">‘an old man of 75 who
                        died 20 years ago</span>’ <span localType="mods-titleinfo">CW7/5</span>. </p>
                <p>At the end of the version of Sgeul Chois Ó Céin which he wrote down from Malcolm
                    MacRae in North Harris, Carmichael later scribbled a piece of information as a
                    memo: A man at Boisdale is said to have this tale. He was building the
                    policeman’s house at Loch Maddy <span localType="mods-titleinfo">CW105/1</span>
                    It’s likely that this man was none other than Patrick Smith. On 25 March 1871,
                    in what must have been a lengthy recording session in Smith’s own house,
                    Carmichael wrote down a twenty-page version of <span localType="mods-titleinfo"
                        >Sgeul Chois Ó Céin</span>, which the seanchaidh had heard from a <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">Canna</span> man some forty years previously.
                    There then follows a seventeen-page romance, <span localType="mods-titleinfo"
                        >Sgeulachd Gas Gruaige</span>, which Smith had heard ‘from an old woman’
                    fifty years beforehand. He ended the céilidh, it seems, by giving Carmichael
                    several historical anecdotes, probably for a paper the gauger was then preparing
                    for his friend the surveyor <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Captain Frederick
                        Thomas</span> about the brochs and castles of the Outer Hebrides <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">[CW119/11-15; CW362 ff.191–2]</span>. It’s
                    probably after Carmichael returned home that night that he scribbled another
                    note at the end of <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Malcolm MacRae</span>’s
                    version of Sgeul Chois Ó Céin, describing Smith as a ‘fine old sgialaiche’ <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">CW105/1: the date here (25 March 1870) is clearly
                        mistranscribed</span>.</p>
                <p>Later that year another folklorist visited Patrick Smith. In autumn 1871 John
                    Francis Campbell embarked on a strenuous tour around storytellers in the
                    Hebrides, probably to recuperate from a distressing few months reporting on the
                    Paris Commune that spring. On 27 September Campbell met Smith ‘on a horse going
                    for peats’ and wrote down several Ossianic items from him, including the story
                    of <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Diarmuid</span> and the accompanying lay
                        <span localType="mods-titleinfo">[NLS Adv. MS 50.2.4 fos.64v, 66–71,
                        76v]</span>. Smith bluntly informed Iain Òg Ile: <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">‘How altered you are since I saw you ten years
                        ago… Then you were a thin lad now you are thick in the flesh &amp; fat and
                        the head is turning hoary.’</span> Campbell notes in his journal that <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">‘[h]e said he could recite very many stories.
                        Those who were there said [he could recite] five or six every winter’s
                        night, he could not tell how many he knew, he said he could not remember
                        [the names of] them all or count them, but when he began, others came into
                        his mind. I feel quite sure that the stories of that man’s mind would fill a
                        large volume.’</span>
                    <span localType="mods-titleinfo">[MWHT ii, 149n.]</span></p>
                <p>Alexander Carmichael would record no more from Patrick Smith. It looks as if
                    ever-increasing family and domestic commitments meant that he was unable to
                    spend as much time writing down long stories as he had when he first arrived in
                    Uist. On 18 November 1877 Patrick Smith died of ‘natural decay’. In <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">Carmina Gadelica</span> Carmichael would pay
                    tribute to him as <span localType="mods-titleinfo">‘[a] famous story-teller and
                        ballad-reciter with whom died much old lore’</span>
                    <span localType="mods-titleinfo">[CG ii, 345n.5]</span>, <span
                        localType="mods-titleinfo">‘rich in literary matter of great and varied

                    <span localType="mods-titleinfo">[CG iii, 230]</span> Alexander Carmichael also
                    recorded material from Smith’s daughter <span localType="mods-titleinfo">Mary
                        Mackintosh (c1828–83)</span>, Gearraidh na Mòine, wife of the tailor <span
