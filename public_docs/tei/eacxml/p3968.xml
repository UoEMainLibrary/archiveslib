            <biogHist>
                <p>Alexander Nicolson was born in Husabost, near Dunvegan, son of a farmer and
                    landed proprietor, a tacksman under the MacLeods, on the Isle of Skye. After
                    studying theology at Edinburgh University, he gave up his plans to join the Free
                    Church ministry and was working as an editor and journalist when he was
                    appointed examiner for the Lothian District. Nicolson served as examiner for
                    only a few years before leaving to pursue a legal career. He was called to the
                    Scottish Bar in 1860, but obtained little practice as an advocate. He was
                    subsequently appointed Assistant Commissioner for the Scottish Education
                    Commission in 1865, in which capacity he visited and inspected the schools of
                    almost all the inhabited Western Isles. In the very same year that he declined
                    an offer of the chair of Celtic at Edinburgh University, a position which
                    Professor John Stuart Blackie had been instrumental in founding, Nicolson, in
                    1872, accepted an appointment to became Sheriff-Substitute, or stewart of the
                    stewarty of Kirkcudbright as it was known then, where he remained until 1885,
                    when appointed sheriff-substitute of Greenock.</p>
                <p>Only four year later, however, in 1893, on grounds of ill health he was forced to
                    retire. Nicolson never married, and died in Edinburgh of heart disease in 1893.
                    His obituary in the Scotsman portrays him as a popular, genial man with ‘a great
                    fund of humour’, and a keen Gaelic scholar who 'rejoiced in all Gaelic things'
                    and was passionate about his homeland of Skye, but who failed to apply himself
                    fully to any branch of industry. Despite that he wrote in a brief
                    autobiographical sketch: “I would rather be remembered as the composer of one
                    good song, than as the writer of many respectable and superfluous books”,
                    Nicolson is chiefly remembered for his revision of the Gaelic Bible, at the
                    behest of the SSPCK, and his collection of Gaelic proverbs and, of course, as
                    the man who gave his name to the highest peak of the Black Cuillin in the isle
                    of Skye: Sgurr Alasdair [Alexander’s Peak] which he first ascended in 1873. </p>
