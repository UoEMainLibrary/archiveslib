            <biogHist>
                <p>Ann MacPherson was born in Glen Kinglass, Loch Etive, in the Parish of
                    Ardchattan, c. 1810 [CG iii, 141]. Her birth does not appear to have been
                    registered, but Ann told Alexander Carmichael that her mother was a MacCallum
                    ‘from Laudal[e] in Morvern &amp; a beautiful singer’ [CW102-121]. In 1851 Ann’s
                    maternal uncle Alexander MacCallum, a house carpenter staying with them at the
                    time, is recorded as having been born in the Parish of Ardchattan, so the
                    Morvern connection may have been further back in the family.</p>
                <p>On 27 December 1839 Ann married William Livingston (1810–1872), ‘Uilleam Mòr’,
                    who was born in Wilsontown, Parish of Carnwath, Lanarkshire. Livingston was the
                    son of Donald Livingston, tailor, and Ann Livingston née MacMillan, both parents
                    probably of Highland origin. At the time of their marriage, both Ann and William
                    were living at Airds Bay, Parish of Muckairn, in present-day Taynuilt. There
                    they would stay for the rest of their lives.</p>
                <p>At the time of the 1841 census William Livingston is recorded as a ‘fisher’. His
                    death certificate, giving him as ‘Farmer &amp; tenant of Salmon Fishings’,
                    suggests that the couple were relatively well off in their community, a
                    supposition strengthened by the three servants recorded as employed in their
                    household by the 1861 census.</p>
                <p>Although they had no children, a young niece of Ann, Margaret MacPherson, born in
                    Glasgow, is recorded as living with them in the 1841 and 1851 censuses. The
                    censuses between 1851 and 1871 also record a James Campbell from Lanarkshire,
                    either a retired ensign or lieutenant, who had served in the 92nd Regiment (the
                    Gordon Highlanders), staying with the couple as a boarder. Campbell may well
                    have been served under Lieutenant Colonel John Cameron in the heavy fighting at
                    Quatre Bras during the campaign at Waterloo in 1815.</p>
                <p>William Livingston died on 17 March 1872 of heart disease. By 1881 Ann was
                    clearly living in somewhat reduced circumstances. Her niece, now the widow
                    Margaret MacDougall, was back living in the household, along with her two sons
                    John, 17, and William, 10, the former born in Muckairn, the latter in Barony,
                    Glasgow. A groom named Duncan MacDougall, evidently another relative, was also
                    present. The house in which they lived, Airds Bay Cottage, was relatively large
                    with seven rooms. This may have encouraged Ann to take in lodgers. It is
                    possible that among them was Alexander Carmichael and his family, who spent some
                    summers at least at Airds Bay from the early 1880s onwards. Indeed, it seems as
                    if Ann Livingston had already moved out of her house into a smaller one by the
                    time Carmichael made her acquaintance. The folklorist himself was staying at
                    ‘Bay Cottage’ in September 1884, while Ann, ‘my aged friend and kind neighbour’
                    was by then living alone, ‘the last of her kindred, in a small cottage near us
                    at Bunawe’ [Lord Archibald Campbell (ed.), Records of Argyll (Edinburgh: William
                    Blackwood and Sons, 1885), 501, 502].</p>
                <p>Carmichael records that he first came to know Ann Livingston, an ‘intelligent and
                    educated woman’ in 1882 [CG iii, 141]. Although ‘already old’:</p>
                <p>‘she was still full of the songs and rimes, the hymns and ballads and traditions,
                    of her native Gleann Conghlais, Glen Kinglass, on Loch Etive. With graphic power
                    and pathetic interest she described the people of her own district and her own
                    day, simple, noble, and neighbourly, the men big and powerful, and women strong
                    and handsome, whom to see was to admire and to know was to love.’ [CG iii,
                    141]</p>
                <p>‘She says that she often tries to soothe her loneliness by singing to herself the
                    old ballads, songs, lullabies, and hymns with which her beloved mother used to
                    soothe her own childhood eyes to sleep nearly eighty years ago.’ [Campbell
                    (ed.), Records, 502]</p>
                <p>From Ann Livingston Carmichael wrote down information regarding Fèill Chonnain,
                    St Connan’s Fair in Glen Orchy; Fèill Mìcheil, the Feast of St Michael; as well
                    as local clearances during the early nineteenth century [CG iii, 141–2]. On the
                    night of Friday 18 September 1884 he took down from her MacNeacain an Dùin, the
                    ‘interesting and instructive’ poem, ‘sung to me with a weird old air’ [Campbell
                    (ed.), Records, 500–1], later written up with an extended essay and printed in
                    Campbell’s Records of Argyll [see CW102-121; CW244; Campbell (ed.), Records,
                    489–505]. It may be that he also recorded from Ann the local lore – including
                    Gaelic terms for the different stages of salmon which she may well have learnt
                    from her husband – preceding and following the song in the field notebook
                    [CW102-121]. Two other items are attributed to Ann Livingston in Carmina
                    Gadelica: an Òra Dìona or Prayer of Protection, and a prayer to Mìcheil Mìl,
                    Michael Militant [CG iii, 108–9, 144–7]. These ascriptions, however, seem rather
                    uncertain.</p>
                <p>By 1891 Ann Livingston, now incapacitated by blindness, was an inmate in the Lorn
                    Combination Poorhouse in Oban. The inaccurate description of her as ‘Formerly
                    Ho[use]maid, Domestic Ser[van]t’ with her age given as 94 (suggesting that she
                    appeared considerably older than she actually was) might imply that she was by
                    that time uncommunicative, a supposition strengthened by the fact that no
                    parents are recorded on her death certificate. Ann Livingston died in Lorn
                    Combination Poorhouse of cancer of the breast on 26 September 1891. Alexander
                    Carmichael would contine to spend summers at her old house, Airds Bay Cottage,
                    until 1900. </p>
