<p>The foundation of this database lies in an earlier database based on the following source:</p>

<ul>
<li>University of Edinburgh: Medical Examinations (later Graduates in Medicine): 1833- . [Edinburgh University Library Special Collections: <a href="http://www.archives.lib.ed.ac.uk/catalogue/cs/viewcat.pl?id=GB-237-EUA-IN1-ADS-STA-8&view=basic">EUA IN1/ADS/STA/8</a>]</li> 
</ul>

<p>As only 205 individuals were keyed into the original database, it is only a sample of those studying during that period.  The possibility of adding further names is being considered.</p>
