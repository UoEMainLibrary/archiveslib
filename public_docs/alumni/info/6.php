
                            <p>This is a digitised copy of the first volume of Laureation & Degrees (First Laureation Album) [Edinburgh University Library Special Collections: <a href="http://archives.collections.ed.ac.uk/repositories/2/archival_objects/17272" target="_blank">EUA IN1/ADS/STA/1/1</a>].  The volume was bound, at some point, out of its proper chronological sequence and remained so until quite recently.  The digitised order reflects the previous disorder.</p>
                            <p>This album begins with the text of the 'sponsio' or
  Confession of Faith (sometimes referred to as the National Covenant) of 1580,
  to which the graduates subscribed, and which continued to be subscribed to by
  Professors and Students for many years. The entries for laureations (or
  graduations) begin in August 1587, when Robert Rollock, the first Principal
  'did laureat the first classe which had passed under his charge in the Colledge
  of Edinburgh, after every one of them had subscrybed the Covenant.' </p>
                            <p>This first class consisted of 47 students, all of whom
  signed their names, a practice which continued well into the 18th century.
  Additions were made against the names of the early graduates, probably by later
  Professors, adding designations such as 'minister verbi' or, for example,
  'Primarius, prius Regens' against the name of Patrick Sands, who was in the
  first class of graduates, and who became Principal in 1620. The Register
  records all graduates up to 1712, and medical graduates from 1710 up to
  1809.The Register itself was active in the University until 1809, and it can be
  safely said that it played a central role in the life of the institution for
  over 200 years. </p>
  <p>Many of the signatures in the volume are of key figures in
  the life of the University, and include those of Robert Rollock, the first
  Principal, William Drummond of Hawthornden, the Poet and Benefactor to the
  University, Robert Leighton, and Hugh Blair.</p>
  
  <p>The volume concludes with a few administrative entries made after 1809.</p>
