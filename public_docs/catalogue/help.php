<h2>What is Catalogued?</h2>

<p>Not all of what we hold is catalogued.  Where possible we have created at least a catalogue record for a collection as a whole.  We are constantly creating new catalogue records, sometimes as part of core work but more often through project work.  Staff often have knowledge of currently uncatalogued material so it is often worthwile asking even if you don't find what you are looking for in the catalogue.</p>

<hr />

<a name="request"></a>
<h2>Consultation Request</h2>

<p>Click on the Request button in the relevant catalogue entry and fill out the form.  You can also <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/information-services/services/library-museum-gallery/crc/help">contact us</a>.</p>

<h2>Reference codes and Shelfmarks</h2>
<p>Today we catalogue to accepted international archival standards, including assigning of reference codes.  In earlier periods most archive and manuscripts were simply identified by their library shelfmark (denoting where they were shelved).  Some of these persist to this day, particularly where cataloguing has still to be done to any level of detail.</p>

<h3>Reference codes</h3>

<p>Each collection has a unique reference code, usually prefixed 'Coll' or 'EUA'.  Items within the collection will be referenced as sub numbers (where lower level cataloguing has been carried out). Due to some historically anomalies, we currently have some material grouped together as collections which are no more than loosely associated items.  This will be rectified but, in order tht these items can still be found in the catalogue, these collection descriptions have been left in place for the moment.</p>

<h3>Shelfmarks</h3>

<p>Historically these collections were managed in a way that parallelled how printed collections were managed, where what something was intellectually was almost synonymous with where it was physically shelved.  Many of these shelfmarks persist to this day and, are still used to manage physical locations and to request material for consultation.  The main shelfmark sequences you may see in catalogue records are:

<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="shelfmarks">
  <tr>
    <th scope="col" width="100">Shelfmark</th>
    <th scope="col">Form</th>
    <th scope="col">Context</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="font-weight: bold;" valign="top" bgcolor="#E1E1E1">Dc, Dh, Dk (etc)</th>
    <td valign="top" bgcolor="#E1E1E1">Usually in the form 2-character code, full stop, first number, full stop, second number, e.g. <em>Dc.1.45</em>.  Occasionally followed by a forward slash and a further number or number span, e.g. <em>Dc.1.45/7</em> or <em>Dc.1.45/3-7</em>.</td>
    <td valign="top" bgcolor="#E1E1E1">The letter code has its origins in the numbers of the Presses in the Old Library in Old College and, it is believed that the first number referred to the shelf within that press.  The full sequence of Dc through to Dp contains a mixture of archives/ms and printed collections items.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="font-weight: bold;" valign="top" bgcolor="#E1E1E1">Da</th>
    <td valign="top" bgcolor="#E1E1E1">'Da' followed by a separator (full stop or space; historically used inconsistently) then a number, e.g. <em>Da.35</em>.  It might then be followed by a sub number or a letter code.  Further information on Da shelfmark variants is in preparation.</td>
    <td valign="top" bgcolor="#E1E1E1">Originally part of the previous sequence, its quantity probably dictated its separation.  It became an early classification scheme for University Archives but had to be largely abandoned in the early 2000s when cataloguing of these begain in earnest.  Some shelfmarks still persist as part of new reference codes.<br /><br />
    <strong>Scholarly citation:</strong> Try to avoid refering to University Archives by Da shelfmarks.  One shelfmark can refer to such a volume of material as to obscure what is being referred to.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="font-weight: bold;" valign="top" bgcolor="#E1E1E1">Gen or MS</th>
    <td valign="top" bgcolor="#E1E1E1">Usually in the form Gen or MS, followed by a full stop then a number, e.g.<em> Gen.240</em>.  There are sometimes sub-numbers, e.g. <em>Gen.240/6</em>.  There is sometimes a single letter suffix, usually 'F' or 'D'; this was an indicator of size only. Gen and MS are one sequence with the prefix changing part way through.</td>
    <td valign="top" bgcolor="#E1E1E1">Probably has its origins in the move from Old College to George Square in the 1960s and the establishment of a new sequence and also the acquisition of much larger collections which seems to really begin around the same point.  Note that there were inconsistencies in pratctice - a single Gen/MS number can refer to a single item, a box or a number of boxes and was not applied consistently over time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="font-weight: bold;" valign="top" bgcolor="#E1E1E1">PC</th>
    <td valign="top" bgcolor="#E1E1E1">Usually simply followed by a number, e.g. <em>PC7</em>, though this is occasionally followed by a sub number.</td>
    <td valign="top" bgcolor="#E1E1E1">Used for material housed in planchests, including architectural drawings and large photographs.</td>

  <tr>
    <th style="font-weight: bold;" valign="top" bgcolor="#E1E1E1">Phot.Ill</th>
    <td valign="top" bgcolor="#E1E1E1">Normally simply followed by a full stop then a number, e.g. <em>Phot.Ill.234</em></td>
    <td valign="top" bgcolor="#E1E1E1">Used for photographs and similar visual material which are shelved separately.  These may be individual items or separated form a larger collection.  Note not all photographs were dealt with in this way.  Historically applied inconsistently so one number can refer to single or group of items.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="font-weight: bold;" valign="top" bgcolor="#E1E1E1">SRC, SRD etc.</th>

  <tr>
    <th style="font-weight: bold;" valign="top" bgcolor="#E1E1E1">Medals, Coins, Objects</th>
    <td valign="top" bgcolor="#E1E1E1">Usually simply followed by a number, e.g. Medals 134</td>
    <td valign="top" bgcolor="#E1E1E1">Regardless of whether prefixed by Medals, Objects, Coins etc., this is one sequence.</td>

<p>Where Reference codes and Shelfmarks are both present in catalogue records, it is adviseable to use both when requesting material for consultation.</p>

<a name="authorities"></a>
<h2>Authority terms</h2>

<p>Some of our catalogue records contain Authority terms (subjects, places, genres, personal names, corporate names, family names).  If you click on them (either from within a catalogue record or by browsing the terms via the search page), you will get a list of catalogue records containing the same term.  Be aware however that many of our catalogue records do not (yet) have these terms included and will not be found by this method.</p>

<h3>Places</h3>
<p>Some Scottish places have been geo-referenced.  If this has been done, then a map (courtesy of the National Library of Scotland) will also appear to show you where this place is located, e.g. XXX.</p>

<h3>Personal names</h3>
<p>Additional biographical information will appear against personal name authorities where this information has been compiled, e.g. XXX.</p>
