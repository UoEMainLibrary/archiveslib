Alexander Dunlop of Paisley. With close family connections to prominent Presbyterians, Dunlop too involved himself with the ministry and became a licentiate of the Church of Scotland. In these turbulent times, he emigrated to the Carolinas combining the functions of soldier and chaplain. He returned to Scotland after the Glorious Revolution 1688-1689, first being offered the appointment of Minister of Ochiltree, and then in Paisley. At the same time, in 1690, the office of Principal of the University of Glasgow fell vacant and it was given to him by William III (William of Orange) who was himself indebted to Dunlop's brother-in-law William Carstares (1649-1715). As an additional mark of favour, Dunlop was made Historiographer for Scotland in 1693. As Principal, he made great efforts to turn the University around from its dilapidated state. He was also a director of the Darien Company into which the University had invested some five hundred pounds of its funds. When the Darien scheme collapsed, he was able to use his experience as a planter in the Carolinas to assist the Company in some small way. William Dunlop died in March 1700. </p> </bioghist> <scopecontent> <p>The collection is composed of the correspondence and papers of Dunlop, spanning the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
