In attendance at the formation of the Society were Dr. Alexander Edington, Dr. G. S. Woodhead, Professor W. S. Greenfield, and Professor J. B. Haycraft. The well-attended meeting was held in the hall of the Royal College of Physicians, Edinburgh, and it was presided over by Dr. Ritchie, President of the Royal College of Physicians. A sub-committee was appointed during the meeting with Dr. Edington (Secretary) and Professor Balfour (Chairman). The first council meeting was held on 11 October 1889 at Dowells' Rooms, George Street, Edinburgh, and the first ordinary meeting of the Society was held in Dowells' Rooms on Friday 1 November 1889, at 7.45 p.m. Meetings were later held at the Philosophical Institution. The Society held regular meetings from 1889 until 2 November 1914 when the question of amalgamation with other Societies was raised. By 1921 there were few members, and the Society was wound up in June 1921.</p> </bioghist> <scopecontent> <p>The records of the Scottish Microscopical Society consist of minute books covering the years 1888-1909, and 1909-1921, and council minutes for 1889-1914.
