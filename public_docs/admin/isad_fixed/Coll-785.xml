He arrived in the Gambia circa 1836 on a special mission to write a grammar of the Mandingo and Foolah languages and to provide a translation service. He found the climate unfavourable and soon returned to England. With the assistance of an African who had returned with him, MacBrair completed his task of compiling a grammar, <title>The Mandingo Grammar</title>, and a translation of the New Testament.
