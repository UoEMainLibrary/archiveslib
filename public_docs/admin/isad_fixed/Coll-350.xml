Although he become very interested in plants as a boy, rather than study botany he followed medical studies in London and Edinburgh. He did not proceed to taking a medical degree however. After marriage in 1816, he settled in Edinburgh and studied anatomy. In 1819 he joined the Wernerian Society and submitted a number of botanical papers both to it and to the Botanical Society of Edinburgh. In 1823 Greville began the publication of the monthly <title>Scottish cryptogamic flora</title> illustrated with his own drawn and coloured plates. Other publications included <title>Flora Edinensis</title> (1824), <title>Icones filicum</title>, and <title>Algae Britannicae</title> (1830). In 1834 he made a tour of Sutherland and again toured in Scotland in 1837, each time collecting specimens for the Botanical Society. Greville was an active opponent of slavery and he served as an anti-slavery delegate from Edinburgh to the then Colonial Office. He was also an advocate of temperance, publishing <title>Facts illustrative of the drunkenness of Scotland with observations on the responsibility of the clergy, magistrates, and other influential bodies</title> (1834). Greville was a Secretary of the Sabbath Alliance and was vocal against the 'legalised desecration' of Sundays by the Post Office, railway companies, and public houses. In 1856, he was elected MP for Edinburgh. Robert Kaye Greville died at his home in the Murrayfield area of Edinburgh on 4 June 1866. He was buried in the city's Dean Cemetary.</p> </bioghist> <scopecontent> <p>The papers consist of: a letter to Professor W.
