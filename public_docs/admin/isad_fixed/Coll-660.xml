He was an apprentice to a house painter before entering Trustees Academy at the Royal Scottish Academy, Mound, Edinburgh, in 1838. He was then a drawing master at Leith High School, and in 1846 he went to Ireland where he became an art master. Nicol painted Irish life and character, often humourously. He returned to Edinburgh in 1849. He was a constant exhibitor at the Royal Scottish Academy. In 1862 he exhibited at the Royal Academy and settled in London but made annual visits to Ireland studying his subjects. Latterly too he turned to Scottish subjects and worked in Pitlochry for a while. In 1885 he retired to Middlesex. Erskine Nicol died in Feltham, Middlesex on 8 March 1904.</p> </bioghist> <scopecontent> <p>The correspondence relates to Nicol's pictures.</p> </scopecontent> <accruals> <p>Check the local Indexes for details of any additions.</p> </accruals> <accessrestrict> <p>Generally open for consultation to bona fide researchers, but please contact repository for details in advance.</p> </accessrestrict> <note> <p>The biographical/administrative history was compiled using the following material: (1) McEwan, Peter J.
