By 1916, the student journal <title>The Gambolier</title> was able to observe that women were finding work in 'fields which, some thirty years ago, would have been regarded as belonging entirely to men' - Public Health officers, private practitioners, lecturers, working in labs, in scientific research and in the organisation and management of hospitals. Meetings of the Edinburgh Women's Medical Society included lectures on subjects as diverse as: the pituitary gland; diseases of the bile passages; germs and disease; and, haemophilia.</p> </bioghist> <scopecontent> <p>The records are composed of: minutes 1913-1924; committee minutes, 1914-1933; account book, 1922-1923 to 1951-1952; receipt book, 1950-1952; and, miscellaneous papers and correspondence, 1949-1952.</p> </scopecontent> <acqinfo> <p>Transferred from the Medical Faculty Office in January 1983, Accession no.
