His parents were from Berwickshire and Roxburghshire, and he was the nephew of the philosopher David Hume (1711-1776). Hume became an Advocate in 1779 and a Sheriff in Berwickshire in 1784, then afterwards in West Lothian. In 1786, he became Professor of Scots Law at Edinburgh University. Sir Walter Scott attended Hume's classes when a student at the University, in his early years. In 1811, Hume was appointed Principal Clerk to the Court of Session, and in 1822 Baron of the Scots Exchequer, a post which he held until the abolition of the body. He had also been a curator of the Advocates' Library in Edinburgh. Hume's publications include <title>Commentaries on the law of Scotland: respecting the description and punishment of crimes</title> (1797), and <title>Commentaries on the law of Scotland respecting trial for crimes</title> (1800). David Hume died at his house in Edinburgh's Georgian New Town on 30 August 1838.</p> </bioghist> <scopecontent> <p>Notes of lectures on the law of Scotland, delivered by David Hume, 1788, at Dc.5.37-38; Notes of lectures on Scots law, circa 1790, at Dc.6.122-124; Lectures on Scots law, circa 1795, at Dc.4.18-19; Lectures on Scots law, 1808-1809, at Gen. 860-861; Lectures on Scots law, 1810-1811, at Gen. 862 and Gen. 1391-1397.
