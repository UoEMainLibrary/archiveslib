The disease was most commonly found in densely populated districts. The first Vaccination Act of 1840 was an early attempt to control the disease but vaccination was provided on a request basis only. The 1871 Vaccination Act heralded compulsory infant vaccination however, and out of this compulsion the anti-vaccination movements were born across the country.</p> </bioghist> <scopecontent> <p>The collection is composed of correspondence relating to the Scottish Anti-Vaccination League, Kirkcaldy, 1896-1897. </p> </scopecontent> <acqinfo> <p>Material purchased from Broughton Books, Edinburgh, November 1989, Accession no.
