He was educated in Dumfries and at Edinburgh University, 1833-1834, after which he continued his scientific studies in Ormskirk. His first paper was read before the Manchester Geological Society in April 1843, and was entitled <title>The climate of the coal epoch</title>. In 1848 Harkness and his father moved to Dumfries and his subsequent papers on the geology and fossils of south-western Scotland built his reputation as a geologist. In 1853 he was appointed Professor of Geology at Queen's College, Cork. In 1854 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and in 1856 Fellow of the Royal Society of London. When Harkness was required to add physical geography, zoology, botany, and mineralogy to his curriculum in 1876, his health broke down. Professor Robert Harkness died on 5 October 1878 just after resigning his Chair.</p> </bioghist> <scopecontent> <p>The Harkness material includes correspondence with Sir Charles Lyell, 1855-1873, letters to Sir Archibald Geikie, 1872-1877, and papers on the geology of the Wexford and Cromer forest beds, 1873. </p> </scopecontent> <acqinfo> <p>Material within Geikie correspondence, transferred from Geology Dept.
