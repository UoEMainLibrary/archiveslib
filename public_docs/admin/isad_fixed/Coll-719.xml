Cragg was a colonial District Officer in Nigeria in the period 1924-1930. He served in different parts of Nigeria, namely: the Niger river area and Kabha 1924-1925, the Benue river area 1926-1927, Bauchi 1927-1928 and Ningi and Azare (both in Bauchi state) 1929-1930. In 1931, Cragg was made a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society (FRGS) for his mapping work in hitherto unexplored territories in Nigeria.</p> </bioghist> <scopecontent> <p>The collection is composed of: a typescript account <title>Violet in Nigeria</title> edited by Margaret A. Kerrich (nee Cragg) from her mother's letters covering the period 1924-1930, and about the life of a District Officer's family; 2 cassette tapes recorded on three of the four sides by Kerrich relating experiences in Nigeria 1931-1932, and based on a diary; a small number of photographs (some of a leopard, possibly 'Piccin'), drawings and miscellaneous items; and, a nameplate for 'Piccin' the leopard which was presented to Edinburgh Zoo by Mrs Gilliat Cragg in 1929 and which died in 1934. The collection is a lively account of problems facing a District officer and his wife in, successively, Niger and Kabha 1924-1925, Benue 1926-1927, Bauchi 1927-1928 and Ninghi and Azare 1929-1930.</p> </scopecontent> <acqinfo> <p>Material purchased from L.
