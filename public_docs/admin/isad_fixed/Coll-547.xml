These bodies came into existence in 1903 and 1905 respectively, the former growing out of the Bureau of Statistics, 1874, and the Bureau of Foreign Commerce, 1897. These earlier bodies themselves grew out of a Statistical Office in the US State Department, 1854-1856.</p> </bioghist> <scopecontent> <p>The US Consular Reports are a collection of information about the economies and markets of other countries - in this case Scotland. They provide statements about the imports and exports between the main ports of Scotland and the US based on the accounts of US consuls in Edinburgh, Leith, Glasgow, Dundee, Aberdeen, and other Scottish towns. There is economic information on Clyde shipbuilding, Dundee trade and social conditions, the bicycle market, the sugar industry, locomotive building, and cattle and dairy farming. There is detail too about labour in Europe.</p> </scopecontent> <acqinfo> <p>Material acquired from Professor T. C. Smout, 1977, Accession no.
