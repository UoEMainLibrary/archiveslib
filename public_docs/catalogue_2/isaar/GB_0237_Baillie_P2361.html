<td class="content"><div title="isaar226"><p>John Baillie was born in 1886, the son of Rev John Baillie
			 (1829-1891), Free Church minister at Gairloch, Ross &amp; Cromarty in the
			 north-west of Scotland, and his wife Annie Macpherson. Following the death of
			 his father, the family home was in Inverness and he was educated at Inverness
			 Royal Academy and the University of Edinburgh. More study was undertaken at
			 both Jena and Marburg and he held assistant positions at the University of
			 Edinburgh before entering the church, as an assistant in 1912 and then being
			 ordained in 1920.</p><p>The First World War saw Baillie playing an active role in both the
			 YMCA and the British Expeditionary Force. The end of that war saw the start of
			 his academic career and his married life. He held number of chairs at the
			 Auburn and Union Thoeological Seminaries in New York and at Emmanuel College,
			 University of Toronto, but he eventually returned to Edinburgh to become
			 Professor of Divinity at New College in 1934. The rest of his professional life
			 saw him returning to North America on a regular basis.</p><p>The advent of the Second World War saw Baillie use the North
			 American links he had maintained to help persuade US entry into the conflict.
			 He was elected as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland
			 and became Dean of the Faculty of Divinity at the University of Edinburgh in
			 1950, holding this position until retrial six years later. A member of both the
			 British Council of Churches and the World Council of Churches, he became a
			 President of the latter.</p></div></td>
