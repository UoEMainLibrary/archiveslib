        <h1>About</h1>

<p>This is  a project based at the University of Edinburgh's Centre for Research  Collections, with the main aims of cataloguing and preserving the papers of  psychologist, educator, and statistician Professor Sir Godfrey Thomson. In the course of the project, the papers of  individuals who worked with Thomson, along with the records of the Godfrey  Thomson Unit for educational research, have also been catalogued.</p>
 <p>The project has proved a collaborative one, with Project  Archivist Emma Anthony working closely with Researcher Caroline Brett from the <a href="http://www.ccace.ed.ac.uk/">Centre for Cognitive Ageing and  Cognitive Epidemiology</a>.</p>


<p>The cataloguing work was supported by the following grant: Wilson, A., Deary, I. J., & Buttars, G. Documenting the understanding of human intelligence: preserving and cataloguing the papers of Professor Sir Godfrey Thomson (1881-1955). Wellcome Trust. March 2013-May 2014. (Ref. 099432/Z/12/Z.)</p>

<p>The collections of the 'Papers of Godfrey Hilton Thomson', the 'Papers of Albert Pilliner', 'Material relating to Elsie G. Taylor', 'Collections of recordings (78rpm) of a lecture given by Godfrey Thomson in 1950' were physically retrieved from their owners by Ian Deary during his work on the following grant: Deary, I. J., Lawn, M., & Bartholomew, D. Reconstructing a Scottish school of educational research 1925-1950. Economic and Social Research Council. January 2006-May 2010. (Ref. RES-000-23-1246.) The deeds of gift from the owners of the materials (Annabella Senior, Sheila Anderson, Elsie G. Taylor, and Vida McFarland, respectively) to the University of Edinburgh are gratefully acknowledged.</p>

<p>The next phase  involves digitising Thomson's papers, which will be aided by two paid internships, training future professionals. The  project has been generously funded by the <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/Funding/Medical-humanities/Funding-schemes/" title="Wellcome Trust" target="_blank">Wellcome Trust's Research Resources in  Medical History Grants Scheme</a>.</p>
